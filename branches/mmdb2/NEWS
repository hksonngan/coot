10A box radius for a 1.5A map at 0.5e/A3.

with line elimination:
---------------------

Elapsed time: 622ms
over grid Nuvw = ( 128, 144, 240) at (10.812,29.349,57.11)
done 49770 lines, rejected 39525 lines
we returned 49770 map vectors
77 in 5.008 seconds = 15.3754 FPS


without line elimination:
-------------------------

Elapsed time: 516ms
over grid Nuvw = ( 128, 144, 240) at (10.812,29.349,57.11)
done 89295 lines, rejected 0 lines
we returned 89295 map vectors
47 in 5.05 seconds = 9.30693 FPS


i.e. for about 100ms extra time spent in contouring, you get much few
lines and therefore ~60% more frames per second -> smoother graphics.

	Synched with clipper.  Fixed up the clipper macro (clipper.m4)
	and the include files. 

	Included the create_tree_node_map() call.

Things slated for after the initial release:

 o Add multiple conformer to residue 
   refinement to "Do the Right Thing"

 o Interactively change phi psi

 o Interactively change chi angles of sidechains

   New graphics card on home computer (geforce 4 mx440)

However, a BIG minus is the apparent display bug - depth cueing doesn't work.

	Now I updated the XFree stuff to Xfree86-*4.2.1-15.73.23

231 in 5.021 seconds = 46.0068 FPS
232 in 5.018 seconds = 46.2336 FPS
231 in 5.004 seconds = 46.1631 FPS
234 in 5.014 seconds = 46.6693 FPS

which is a 63% performance improvement over last week.
