mon_lib_add_chiral() adds a chiral restraint to the dictionary.

It tests volumn_sign (as string) for POS or NEG, and only if those are
set does it add it.

coot::protein_geometry::assign_chiral_volume_targets() checks each
restraint with has_unassigned_chiral_volumes() (calling
has_unassigned_chiral_volume() [and this checks volume_sigma_ < 0.0) .
We need to make sure that that is not unassigned when we include BOTH.

We do this now by in the dict_chiral_restraint_t constructor (in
protein_geometry.hh) by setting volume_sigma_ to 1.0.

When there is a BOTH restraint, exclude it (for now).
