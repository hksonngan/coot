How are carbohydrates handled in Coot?

Monomer restraints

Link restraints, including N and O links (how does the library handle these?)

Link restraints between monomers - link searching.  Why?  Because LINK
cards are often wrong or missing (this was even more so before the
recent remediation of the PDB) and don't provide a description of the
link type.

Glyco-tree searching - is this a standard tree? oligomannose, complex and hybrid.

Tree-dependent, position-dependent "next residue type and link" selection.

Density fitting, alpha 1-6 problems. Candidate model, conformation
selection, trans, gauche(+), gauche(-).
