   CBQ plane restraint? of 0BU in 4mtz - should be flat but isn't.

* Fixed.

----

 Single quotes around the name is a bad idea:

 LCM LCM 'N,N'-butane-1,4-diylbis(2,3-dihydroxybenzamide)' non-polymer 46 26 "."

 wwPDB uses double quote.  pyrogen should do that too.

----

   where are the coordinates in output when a PDBe cif file is input?  or even a mol!

* Done.

----


   pyrogen 2XS in 4oa7 is fails

---

   Try to link with pyrogen CCP4 SRS - so that we can search vs know ligands.

---


Caffeine: 'CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C'
   has plane restraints?

  should I worry about that?

  313, look at resulting partial charges

[20:57:58] UFFTYPER: Unrecognized atom type: S_5+4 (6)

What is this telling me?

   Put the amino-acid (and nucleic acid) name matching into pyrogen (not GLY, ALA)

   can we do ring counting?  What about RingInfo?

    What is coot::regularize() doing?  Creating a molecule but not returning it?

   The fallback bond lookup should harmonic average the permissive
   bonds (if it can) - except if it's a bond to a hydrogen. 

* Done.

pyrogen -n -M -o DB00225 drugbank/DB00225.smiles

  pyrogen -p -m thing.cif i.e. without specifying -t

* Done.
