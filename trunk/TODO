------

    Release 0.4

   o Cootaneer

   o Richardson rotamers

   o Torsion General

   o Multiple model ligand overlaying

   o Kevin's Ramachandran Refinement target

   o Problem SHELX .ins file, enable bonds to symmetry atoms?

   o Gtk Timeout for reading socket strings

* Done in 0.3.2 in fact.

-----

   Release 0.5

   o Use Eugene's new link-reading code

   o Problem SHELX .ins file, enable bonds to symmetry atoms?

   o Valgrind long/multiple fit-proteins

   o insertion codes for intelligent next atom

   o Add some SHELX reading to the test suite.

   o Dynamic distances on moving atom/fragments

   o fix db-main so that it doesn't spew error messages

   o Select residues (for new molecule) by sphere

   o Add Chiral Volume Outliers to Omega Angle Plot

   o Make the Omega Angle Plot update properly

-----

    Release 0.7 

   o Redo sequence view 

   o NCS differences graph (use master chain)

   o Hydrogens from a SHELXL molecule

   o Mouse bindings, consistency with MG

   o helix fitting overshoots

   o check for updates?

   o Try again to add chiral volumes to the geometry target function

   o (un)Label atoms in given atom selection

   o More work on ligand bonding
       Things with Cl etc, 
       O->P bonds
       faster bonding with many molecules

   o Kleywegt plot should not draw ("wrapped") long arrows

   o Pre-and post check of chiral volume and cis peptide bonds when
     using refine zone

   o colour by B-factor CA mode

   o Lasso (perhaps) active atoms to select atoms for R/Ting?  
     So that fragments of monomers can be moved independently

   o Update python files

   o rotamer-score function needs to be filled

   o "Find Waters" sometimes does not to put waters in what seems sensible
     places - why is that?


------
    
    Release 0.8 

   o User pickable atoms

   o Other Button: tw & penny

   o handle links properly (as above).

   o multiple representations?

   o "Thick bonds" for ligands etc

   o mutate residue range for bases

------

   Release 0.9, Facelift-release

   o Clean up menu items, use Preferences.

   o Switch to GTk2, guile1.8.  Dump Gtk1 interface, re-write build-it 
     script
