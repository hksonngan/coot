------

    Release 0.4

   o Gtk Timeout for reading socket strings

* Done in 0.3.2 in fact.


   o Cootaneer

   o Richardson rotamers

   o Multiple model ligand overlaying

   o Kevin's Ramachandran Refinement target


-----

   Release 0.5

   o Torsion General

   o Use Eugene's new link-reading code

   o Problem SHELX .ins file, enable bonds to symmetry atoms?

   o Valgrind long/multiple fit-proteins

   o insertion codes for intelligent next atom

   o Add some SHELX reading to the test suite.

   o Dynamic distances on moving atom/fragments

   o Problem SHELX .ins file, enable bonds to symmetry atoms?

   o fix db-main so that it doesn't spew error messages

   o Select residues (for new molecule) by sphere

   o Add Chiral Volume Outliers to Omega Angle Plot

   o Make the Omega Angle Plot update properly

   o Revisit CCP4mg button

   o on_filename_filter_toggle_button_toggled() looks up the
     fileselection by going through all names of file selections. This
     is ugly (gives terminal warnings).  Make the user data also encode 
     information about which fileslection this is (in 1000s, say).

-----

    Release 0.6

   o Redo sequence view 

   o NCS differences graph (use master chain)

   o Hydrogens from a SHELXL molecule

   o Mouse bindings, consistency with MG

   o helix fitting overshoots

   o check for updates?

   o Try again to add chiral volumes to the geometry target function

   o (un)Label atoms in given atom selection

   o More work on ligand bonding
       Things with Cl etc, 
       O->P bonds
       faster bonding with many molecules

   o Kleywegt plot should not draw ("wrapped") long arrows

   o Pre-and post check of chiral volume and cis peptide bonds when
     using refine zone

   o colour by B-factor CA mode

   o Lasso (perhaps) active atoms to select atoms for R/Ting?  
     So that fragments of monomers can be moved independently

   o Update python files

   o rotamer-score function needs to be filled

   o "Find Waters" sometimes does not to put waters in what seems sensible
     places - why is that?

   o Calculate NCS matrices from molecules created by
     new_molecule_by_atom_selection()

 ------
    
    Release 0.8 

   o User pickable atoms

   o Other Button: tw & penny

   o multiple residue ranges, glycosylation, covalent bond entities
  
   o handle links properly (as above).

   o multiple representations?

   o "Thick bonds" for ligands etc

   o mutate residue range for bases

------

   Release 0.9, Facelift-release

   o Clean up menu items, use Preferences.

   o Switch to GTk2, guile1.8.  Dump Gtk1 interface, re-write build-it 
     script
