   What's Planned for the Upcoming Coot Releases?


------

    Release 0.4, Dec 2007


   o Richardson rotamers

   o Try again to add chiral volumes to the geometry target function

   o Add Chiral centre inversion and cis peptide generation check 
     after refinement or regularization.

   o Make the Omega Angle Plot update properly

   o Add Chiral Volume Outliers to Omega Angle Plot

   o Post-install slim the binaries

   o Do the strand restraints work well under refinement?
  
   o Add planar peptide restraints as default

   o Add atom selection by sphere 

   o Add map masking by variable radius about atom (selection)

   o Cootaneer

   o Activate test suite

   o Faster bonding of multiple models e.g. 1O5P.pdb.  It should take
     1 or 2 seconds.


-----

   Release 0.5 Dec June 2008

   o To make the test non-tedious, especially on slow computers, we
     need a set-atoms-attributes that takes a list of attribute sets.
     No need to re-calulate the bonding for each atom move.
     No need to redraw, except once at the end.

   o Make a new dialog: clear up old/backup files on exit.
     86400 seconds per day

   o Kleywegt plot should not draw ("wrapped") long arrows

   o Torsion General

   o Lars Prade crash.  Try doing actions in a directory that you can't
     write to.  Test Geometry validation.

   o work in the svn-revision.cc.  svn-revision.cc should be in
     Makefile.am, and be part of the tar file.  It should be generated
     after every time we do a svn update or commit.

   o On pressing the filter button we get this ugliness:

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: coords_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: dataset_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: coords_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: dataset_fileselection1

     on_filename_filter_toggle_button_toggled() looks up the
     fileselection by going through all names of file selections. This
     is ugly (gives terminal warnings).  Make the user data also encode 
     information about which fileselection this is (in 1000s, say).

   o Dynamic distances on moving atom/fragments

   o Make build-it-gtk2 and use it.

   o Correct CISPEP if needed cards on writing pdb.

   o Mutate should not change the order of the atoms in the pdb.
     http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/latest/atom-format.html

   o Fix this:  
      ./configure: line 26927: ./po/POTFILES.in: No such file or directory
      (it comes from building from the tar file)

   o Kevin's Ramachandran Refinement target

   o Use Eugene's new LINK-reading code.

   o Fix Charlie Bond's shelx ins writing bug ("shelx woe", 10 sept 2007)

   o Valgrind long/multiple fit-proteins

   o "Thick bonds" for ligands etc

   o Insertion codes for intelligent next atom

   o Add some SHELX reading to the test suite.  Insulin for starters.
     Check that the space groups agree.

   o graphics::molecules should be a std::vector

   o Copy fragment (new-molecule-by-atom-selection) does not
     recalculate the NCS.  It should.

   o Mails from Phil Evans, Stephen Graham, Early April 2008 about SEG
     ids.  Doing a NCS loop with Seg ids.  Doing a mutation with Segids
     (might be the same issue).  The segid for the new atoms should be
     inherited from those of the rest of the residue (if they are
     consistent).

   o test/fix hardware stereo in Gtk2 mode.  Also side-by-side  
     problem described (for example) by Randy Read.

   o NCS Ligands: if we find a ligand C in molecule A, we should look
     for a similar blob near molecule B and try to fit the same kind of
     ligand there as well [JED]

   o If we have guile scripting in configure, then we should check for
     net-http and goosh have been installed.  If not, fail gracefully,
     not obscurely at run time!  
     net-http and goosh to go into Coot directly?  Maybe not, the get 
     installed in a different place.  Hmm.

   o The default occupancy for new atoms in a shelx molecule should be
     11.0.  Is it? [JED]

   o How about a post-swig command to add #ifdef USE_PYTHON around 
     coot_wrap_python.cc (or is it coot_wrap_python_pre.cc?)

   o Check Richardson Rotatmer library is correctly used for GLN, ASN, PRO.
     Ask about Rotamer misses.  Well, the dictionary is fine. Why does
     molprobity web site gives less bad rotamers then? (First: Does it?).
     Yes it does: e.g. for 1sar molprobity notes only these:
     "Bad rotamer B  47 GLN (0.3%)" 
     "Bad rotamer A  91 LEU (0.4%)" 
     "Bad rotamer A  13 PRO (0.9%)" 
     "Bad rotamer B  41 GLU (0.7%)" 

     There are 10 times more for Coot.  
     (fix-nomenclature-errors doesn't fix anything)



-----

    Release 0.6 and 0.7 [Sept 2008]

   o Add the reading of a good map and a CNS map to tests.

   o Put globularize protein into Coot.  Make it a bit more clever?

   o Garib wants a function to move waters close to the protein.

   o Use LSQ for NCS matrices.

   o Use libglade

   o multiple residue ranges, glycosylation, covalent bond entities
  
   o Redo sequence view 

   o NCS differences graph (use master chain)

   o Hydrogens from a SHELXL molecule

   o Mouse bindings, consistency with MG

   o helix fitting overshoots

   o consider making bonds to hydrogens thinner

   o Problem SHELX .ins file, enable bonds to symmetry atoms?

   o check for updates?

   o Revisit CCP4mg button

   o Gtk2 coot: set the colour patch in the map properties and
     symmetry molecule colouring (needs version 2.6).  There is some
     problem in the update, how do I set continuous updates on the
     resulting colour chooser?

   o (un)Label atoms in given atom selection

   o More work on ligand bonding
       Things with Cl etc, 
       O->P bonds
       faster bonding with many molecules

   o colour by B-factor CA mode

   o Lasso (perhaps) active atoms to select atoms for R/Ting?  
     So that fragments of monomers can be moved independently

   o Update python files

   o How about a post-swig command to add #ifdef USE_PYTHON around 
     coot_wrap_python.cc (or is it coot_wrap_python_pre.cc?)

     Is that necessary now?  In build-coot-fc4-gtk2,
     coot_wrap_python.cc is generated and so is an practically empty
     coot_wrap_python.lo

   o rotamer-score function needs to be filled

   o "Find Waters" sometimes does not to put waters in what seems sensible
     places - why is that?

   o Calculate NCS matrices from molecules created by
     new_molecule_by_atom_selection()

   o Check the distribution of selection of phi/psis from
     random-phi-psi function matches a Ramachandran plot

   o Randy's side-by-side frame drawing?

   o Investigate communcation with PISA

   o "Fit ligand here" which gets a monomer then does a ligand search
     based on the blob at the current position.

   o Non-bonded contacts.  Can they be speeded up.  What about nbcs
     with Hydrogens.  Are they good?  Refine 50 residues and profile.

   o Why does loop fitting fail on residue 96A of tutorial-modern.pdb?

   o Make fit-loop work backward.  

   o Profile the bonding on reading in a ribosome fragment. 2 minutes? 
     Not good.

   o Make a demo script that downloads data and runs it - add it to
     the package and make it available to run from extensions.

   o consider a function generator for dialog box of buttons.  Because
     we need a function that accepts args for close-dialog and one
     that does not.  A macro maybe.

   o Rotate/Translate a whole protein (many chains)

   o Geometric distortions graph for alt confs - currently broken?

   o Update stand-alone refinement program. 
     (Write a test for it?)

* Update done. Tried test.  Problem in greg child process. Upgrade to
  guile-1.8.3.  Does that fix the greg child process problem?  If not,
  mail list.  And give up.  Check how greg behaves on compile/build - 
  it tests itself before install.

   o The zooming in out out of a Ramachandran plot is inelegant.
     Needs fixing.

   o Integrate scripting functions into main documentation somehow

   o When fitting waters in a low resolution(ish) map (from buccaneer
     tutorial), the water were often placed in protein density - it was
     missing the fact that the "water" density was connected to the
     protein density - because we only look at the masked map.
     (see bucca-tut on memory stick)

   o does --flood work?

   o Use LSQ not SSM for NCS ghost matrix.
     (Make a speed test.)

   o *create* a molecule by symmetry, not (just) write it out.
      Consider a dialog to Write/Create a symmetry molecule.


 ------
    
    Release 0.8 [Nov 2008?]

   o User pickable atoms

   o sort out the includes so that I use -I .. and
     #include "ideal/geometry.hh" etc.

   o Other Button: tw & penny

   o handle links properly (as above).

   o multiple representations?
  
   o Add Terminal Residue should pick up from the assigned sequence.
     Should work for bases too.

   o mutate residue range for bases

   o Fix leak and deprecated functions message.

   o Bring partial charges to electrostatic surface

   o Activate molecule_class_info_t deconstuctor.  

* No need now.

   o Add parentheses if they are missing from an interactive scripting
     command

   o Make the N and M zoom keys work with multiframes, rather than a
     step/jump in zoom.

------

   Release 0.9, Facelift-release 

   o Oxidized cysine - with a modification

   o Clean up menu items, use Preferences.

   o Internationalize (enable translations)

   o Switch to GTk2, guile1.8.  Dump Gtk1 interface, 

   o re-write build-it script

   o read multiple files from shift and ctrl clicking in the file selection.
