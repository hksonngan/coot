---------------
* THINGS TO DO BEFORE 0.5.1 RELEASE *
---------------

   o be up-to-date with all python scripts and tests
up-to-date 09/09/08
tests rev 1378


04/09/08
   o loop building backwards in scheme (use python?)?

07/10/08
   o make pygtk gtk1 compliant (incl import gobject test)

---------------
* TO DO THINGS *
---------------

   o clean-up use of probe/reduce command_name and command (python):
      actually should not delete and overwrite group_settings.py
      upon installation, in case people change the name of probe/reduce here.

   o speed up NCS by using Kevin's LSQ (user changeable)

   o test vista compositing (* Done?!?!)

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are)

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o ribbons from aesop python things from CCP4MG (at some point)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o fragment fitting/search

   o rsync builds to Paul's dir

   o revisit python sockets

   o fix threading in python 'Coot News'

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o "Check for updates" button? (need to know which OS we are on, maybe 
     from the install dir?!)

   o read_shelx ins file:
	 does it remove comments correctly? (! comment) from line!!!!

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check (*Done?!)

   o high resolution auto-build

14/08/08
   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

14/08/08 
   o change orientation of refinement toolbar and make it dockable to 
     other sides of main window

14/08/08
    o make guile-gtk properly gtk2 complient (esp. text-view)

29/08/08
	o refinement of H at high resolution blows H around (fixed?)
	
	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?)

	o pictures in manual (how and where!?) Maybe more extensive (advanced)
	  tutorial!?

10/09/08
   o no bond colours if no element column in pdb file (e.g. CNS files)
     try to guess?! use coordconv??

16/09/08
   o 'new', short display manager

22/09/08
   o current directory in chooser shortcuts

   o fix size of chooser dialog (if possible, gtk2 bug?!)

04/10/08
   o make toolbutton GUI/wizard


---------------

---------------

   o make coot icons anti-alias

* Done

   o fit_gap in both direction => dialog to select A or B

* Done

   o auto-mutate after add terminal residue with sequence

* Done

   o find 32/64 bit povray exe (WinCoot) [Yen-Chywan]

* Done

   o python's read_refmac_log to run after schemey refmac run 
	 (if we have pygtk)?

* Done

   o schemey run-refmac to work with twinning/sad etc.

* Done (testing?!)

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check

* Done (put on Kay's WIKI)

27/08/08
   o Windows installer:
     - question overwriting of runwincoot.bat
     - make the 'start in' directory user changeable (use SetOutPath!?)
       * for both make sure it works (sensibly) with a silent installer!!!

* Done
