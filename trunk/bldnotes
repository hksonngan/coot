---------------
* THINGS TO DO BEFORE 0.6 RELEASE *
---------------

   o ccp4mg ellipsoids

   o revisit refinement convergence of alt conf refinement

   o add all GtkWidget and similar functions as ignore to coot.i (script)

   o simulate middle mouse with Alt left ?!

   o running shelx should be 'threaded'

   o annotations in Extensions

   o labelling with 'l' doesnt show status bar info (feature/bug?)

   o refinement weighting by occupancy

   o (scripting) GUI to find zero occ atoms.

* Done (python; needs guile/scheme)

   o WinCoot:
        - update dictionaries!!
	- update to python 2.6 (now with pygtk etc)
	- before stable release copy python over
	- silent python installation? Possible? (http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/)

04/09/08
   o loop building backwards in scheme (use python?)?

* Done?!

22/12/08
   o fat bonds remain after ball-n-stick from additional repr (TS)
* dont understand (seems ok to me)

   o notes to self:
     - ribbons: include ribbons
  		save the ribbons for later use (?, maybe better to update and generate new)
		sort out colouring
		sort out licence (add to svn and commit) test dist first
		use CMMDBManager somehow...

   o windows build: dont update src tar whilst building (if possible)

04/11/08 CCP4 dev meeting:
   o bulk sovlent correction for refmac?

   o filechooser in save mode doesnt have delete & rename file!? Shall/can we?!

   o windows test system:	- start XP for testing after installer build
				- install WinCoot silent
				- download test data and unittests
				- run tests
				- send email about status/or notify otherwise

   o spawn refmac and use timer to get progress rather than blocking
     the application; maybe plus kill button?! NEEDS guile version
* Done (python)

---------------
* TO DO THINGS *
---------------

   o fix OXT refinement
     (maybe not now, as it may be fixed with MODRES etc...)

   o density histogram graph?!

   o additional representations: hide parts of model (use bond thickness 0?!?
	bond thickness 0 doesnt work. hiding seems tricky!?

   o revisit python sockets

   o merge build-it-win with buid-it-gtk2-simple?!

   o test vista compositing (* Done?!?!)

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are)

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o fragment fitting/search

   o rsync builds to Paul's dir

   o fix threading in python 'Coot News'

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o "Check for updates" button? (need to know which OS we are on, maybe 
     from the install dir?!)

   o read_shelx ins file:
	 does it remove comments correctly? (! comment) from line!!!!

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check (*Done?!)

   o high resolution auto-build

14/08/08
   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

14/08/08 
   o change orientation of refinement toolbar and make it dockable to 
     other sides of main window

* Done (but not automatically to change orientation)

14/08/08
    o make guile-gtk properly gtk2 complient (esp. text-view)

29/08/08
	o refinement of H at high resolution blows H around (fixed?)
	
	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?)

	o pictures in manual (how and where!?) Maybe more extensive (advanced)
	  tutorial!?

10/09/08
   o no bond colours if no element column in pdb file (e.g. CNS files)
     try to guess?! use coordconv?? new mmdb should fix

16/09/08
   o 'new', short display manager

22/09/08
   o fix size of chooser dialog (if possible, gtk2 bug?!)

04/10/08
   o simultaneous refinement of alt confs

06/11/08
   o individual runwincoot.bat for multiuser WinCoot installation [Neer Asherie]

---------------
* DONE THINGS *
---------------

   o new options for recentre in gtk2 file chooser - combobox (and extensions - radiobuttons)

* Done 

19/01/09

   o stereo/mono button for side-by-side stereo [Victor Alves]

* Done

   o antialiasing in s-b-s stereo only left panel (bg colour messed up too) [Victor Alvez, me]

* Done

   o Display Manager position setting not reliable (same for Go to Atom - fixed?!)?! [Victor Alves]

* Done

15/01/09
   o update Refmac GUI SAD as in new CCP4i

* Done

   o after associated sequence no sequ input in fit loop
