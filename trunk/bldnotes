* THINGS TO DO BEFORE 0.5.1 RELEASE *
---------------
   o notes to self:
     - backup windows imgs
     - revise script to delete older binaries.

04/11/08 CCP4 dev meeting:
   o bulk sovlent correction for refmac?
   o zip/unzip pdb backup files in windows via Python?
   o spawn refmac and use timer to get progress rather than blocking
     the application; maybe plus kill button?!
   o dont use TLS in refmac if we dont have the button (i.e. new refmac)
   o Ramachandran restraints check button for loop fit
     - backup before fitting?
   o do loop building 1/2 from N and 1/2 from C terminus for langer loops (>=6?)


04/10/08
   o make toolbutton GUI/wizard

* Done (check which ones to use!?!)

  (o progress bars for refmac e.g.)

   o be up-to-date with all python scripts and tests
scripts rev 1525
tests   rev 1525


04/09/08
   o loop building backwards in scheme (use python?)?


30/10/08
   o LSQ option for ncs copy residue range

---------------
* TO DO THINGS *
---------------

   o additional representations: hide parts of model (use bond thickness 0?!?

   o revisit python sockets

   o merge build-it-win with buid-it-gtk2-simple?!

   o speed up NCS by using Kevin's LSQ (user changeable)

   o test vista compositing (* Done?!?!)

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are)

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o ribbons from aesop python things from CCP4MG (at some point)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o fragment fitting/search

   o rsync builds to Paul's dir

   o fix threading in python 'Coot News'

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o "Check for updates" button? (need to know which OS we are on, maybe 
     from the install dir?!)

   o read_shelx ins file:
	 does it remove comments correctly? (! comment) from line!!!!

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check (*Done?!)

   o high resolution auto-build

14/08/08
   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

14/08/08 
   o change orientation of refinement toolbar and make it dockable to 
     other sides of main window

* Done (but not automatically to change orientation)

14/08/08
    o make guile-gtk properly gtk2 complient (esp. text-view)

29/08/08
	o refinement of H at high resolution blows H around (fixed?)
	
	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?)

	o pictures in manual (how and where!?) Maybe more extensive (advanced)
	  tutorial!?

10/09/08
   o no bond colours if no element column in pdb file (e.g. CNS files)
     try to guess?! use coordconv??

16/09/08
   o 'new', short display manager

22/09/08
   o fix size of chooser dialog (if possible, gtk2 bug?!)

04/10/08
   o simultaneous refinement of alt confs

27/08/08
   o Windows installer:
     - question overwriting of runwincoot.bat
     - make the 'start in' directory user changeable (use SetOutPath!?)
       * for both make sure it works (sensibly) with a silent installer!!!

* Done

04/09/08
   o check licence header in python(-test) modules

   Notes from Phenix

   o readline not accessible with ftp but with http in build-it-gtk2-simple?!
     may just be temporarily?!

* Done, server was temporarily down

   o compile without GSL fails in graphics-info.hh as redefinition of 
     refinement_results_t -> check (remove in graphics-info.hh?!?)

* Done, compile without gsl now (not sure how usefull and if as functional as possible)

   o update the tutorial with Kevin's figures?!

* Done

   o update WinCoot website for new probe/reduce use

* Done
