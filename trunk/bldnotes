-------------------------------------------------------
* THINGS TO DO BEFORE 0.7.2 RELEASE * ONLY URGENT THING
-------------------------------------------------------

Fix installer guile warning for windows feel.
Test spider drag and drop

FIX COOT_REFMAC_DIR for x86 windows with spaces (and/or umlauts)!


-- before 0.8

Windows:
 o distribute src code!!!
 o change runwincoot.bat to (win)coot.bat
 o write things to WINDIR (rather than HOME)
 o check if    clipper::ClipperInstantiator::instance().destroy(); is still needed in c-interface-gui.cc

---- FINISH URGENT ----

ESMAX 2012:
- add terminal residue (after assos. sequence) does not mutate automatically
- toolbar disappears when playing around (disable) in preferences

BioCrys 2012:
- sequencing GUI: give more approriate error messages, e.g. if chain 
	id is missing 
- preferences of older Coot versions may not be compatible with newer ones.
	Maybe only try to import, to avoid crashes!
- Tutorial 2: 
  o try to move baton building to later
  o update position of baton build (other modelling tools or such)

CCP4 APS 2012:
- GUI for patterson (Garib)

CCP4 SW:
- seq vs PIR have extra button to insert, delete, mutate
- Windows: save working dir directory to properties/start in (possible?)
- powerpoint plug in

- add nomenclature error check to preferences
- focus on button of nomenclature error dialog
- bind arrow keys to translation!?
- show all bond distances (angles etc?) for ligand/residue
- update WIKI (key bindings)

OIST-CCP4
- indicate rotamer option somewhere/how [PhilE]
- delete/hide DB loop candidates after accepting?!
- stereo: shift/shear rather than rotate [PhilE]
- brightness warning dialog behind other dialog-> move forward?!
- change occ for master (accept return or just tick button)
- after change the canvas (geometry) doesnt work for non-aa any more
- improve seq assignment interface (take all seq, assign to all prot chains etc)
- seq alignment produces N-term gaps which are not there... (gap to -2.5?)

APS 2011(?)
- copy NCS (chain and residue range) to specific chains (not just all)
- wider range for B sharpening (est. from Wilson?! determine cf Bruenger?) - needed?
- automatically adjust NCS matrix type (i.e. fast for larger mols/more ncs)
- backrub selection in refinement selection dialog
- 

CCP4
- baton build no chainid (?)
- 2nd baton build 'overrides' 1st

notes from BioCrys
- correct resno bsed on associated sequence (note: associate sequence produces
	nonsens gaps at ends)
- associate sequence GUI result GUI buttons, have action too rather than only
	go-to-atom (have pair of buttons)

 
notes APS CCP4 workshop
- document refmac extra params + lib files location (note to self ?!)

scripting exercise
- shortcut for setting 0, 1, 0.5 occupancy
- extend helix
- adjust alt conf/occupancy
- variance test for aa
- doublicate residue range with alt conf


----------------
* TO DO THINGS *
----------------

**** General ****


   o proper sphere selection (without neighbouring crap) and keeping
	of all specs (and alt confs) - use double mmdb selection method
	from Eugene

   o add more things to Preferences, e.g. no of auto refine residues steps;
	Preferences could include all (almost) default
	settings from globjects e.g.
	add zero occ box size??
	set_default_initial_contour_level_for_map
	set_label_on_recentre_flag(state)

   o make auto_read column labels public and expandable (cf pdb, mtz extension
	list)

   o user defined click should keep selecting mouse pointer

   o desensitise refmac buttons etc if no ccp4/refmac installed

   o add (more sensible) timeout for download at EDS (and others?)

   o optional: do not increment file save no/automatically overwrite (dangerous)

   o torsion angle refinement: 
	- shrink atom ardii or downweight nonbonded
	- use phenix updated torsion library

   o add most common ligands to find?!

   o views play is not interuptable?!

   o check that labels cannot be set to black accidentally/reset

   o colour/display residue/ligand by distortion score (like mogul) but based
	on dictionary (better than nothing!)

   o backup file does not change name when saved in between (Feature/bug?)

   o Additional representations need tree and/or other better navigation

   o Additional representations/ballNstick tick marks do not update with 
	Clear Ball and Stick 

   o Water validation tick partial occupancy removes most other waters too

   o Check NCS copy when insertions etc. May need update of matrix
	and/or use of SSM rather than LSQ. Mmh. Tricky

   o save screenshot (and maybe other figures - or else) doesnt have a
	root directory to save in set (in file chooser)

   o NCS not always identified properly (e.g. 3c10)
	(ERROR:: An NCS reference chain finding error has occured)

   o Edit phi/psi shown appropriate rama underneath

   o Kleywegt plot shouldnt be sensitive to non-displayed residues

   o validation (and similar) graphs shoudl be aligned

   o Cys in symmetry looses SG

   o raster3d: water as sphere, include labels, make surfaces, comment in code

   o ligand searching: split in smaller fragments then torsion search and/or
	use fragment for partial disordered ligand

   o change chain ID: automatically check overlap (plus warning)

   o mutate all Met->Mse

   o refinement with non-bonded terms: select larger area for non-bonded only

   o shift sequence/insert residue (for out-of-register errors)

   o turn off backup before phosphorylation

   o include gsl.h (or such) in gsl config test

   o edit charge of ions (atoms)

   o List of residues (e.g. alt conf) maybe display res type too

   o extend alt conf from side chain to whole (and vv)

   o EDS needs better error/fail handling!

   o ..same for get from pdbe (when no or bad cif, e.g. 2MBR)

   o Ca->main Chain for whole chain (not just zone)

   o give warning (dialog) when trying to make a main chain from less
	than 6 CA

   o display python/guile info in about dialog

* Done (may be done nice?!)

   o fix icons for CENTOS, Red hat etc. (replace with fixed_icons.tgz?)

   o pisa: - H-bonds always displayed 
	   - ignores alt-conf for H-bonds (gives warning in get atom spec)
 	   - works only for v 1.13 and above (python)
 	   - use qtpisa?!

   o accept_regularizement does not effect the gui(s ?)

   o add term residue in radius around?

   o give sequence view window a title (and maybe many more...).

   o reset (cap) ANISO 

   o change kleywegt chains in plot
	(only display single chains in Ramachandran - same dropdown?!)

   o print Ramachandran outliers

   o set_go_to_atom_chain_residue_atom_name (and maybe others, for sure 'space')
	do not update environment distances

   o cancel plane picking!!!

   o Validation summary

   o graphical ssm/lsq output

   o read pdb string

   o fix modal show_select_map_dialog in all instances!!

   o 'map_scroll_button_2' widget not found (display manager warning)

   o update sequence view after rename and renumber chains/residues

   o gradually include residues for refinement, good if completely out 
	(maybe not)!?

   o check for updates in About?! Include info on pre- or release!?

   o phs file dialog, make fill/expand properly

* Done (quick fix)

   o domain NCS (use parrot's code?!)

   o make LINK search and LINK in pdb

   o default bond length (e.g.) preferences conflict with state file

   o seq view colour by alignment (optional/button)

   o Go to Atom does not update when open and new molecule gets created

   o delete chain (model) function (in scripting I guess)

   o pick pointer disappears when using delete hydrogens (maybe in others too)
	when keeping dialog open

   o show symmetry axis !?

   o grab focus of loaded state file window (only Win?)

   o recalculate NCS

   o 'force' NCS on non-matching sequences (*done?!)

   o validate on top waters (already done maybe in 0.7)

from Osaka 2010

   o add preferences, dock accept refine etc in tutorial!?

   o fix atoms dont give traffic lights (bug?)

   o toolbar for other modelling tools?

   o (more) menu separators (?)

   o remove model fit refine dialog (for gtk2?)?

-
   o symmetry phosphates of DNA are bonded and not (i.e. get cross)

   o what about ONLY torsion angle restraints for low res?

   o add solvent molecule creates new monomers every time, check for existing ones

   o space bar kills density fit window; feature or bug

   o Difference map peaks do not respond to . , shortcuts

   o symmetry colour button doesnt update (needs proper colour button)

   o enable Alt key for scripting keyboard shortcuts

   o water check for B below threshold?!

   o Tooltips for residues in new sequence view?! (wait for goocanvas - has
	build-in tooltip)

   o Edit Chi for hydrogens not working (H from reduce at least)

   o transform whole asu for packing comparision?! (check mmdb, use ORIGX?)

   o doublication of find strand/find ss (Extensions, Other tools)

   o glycosylate residue

04/11/08 CCP4 dev meeting:
   o activate bulk solvent correction for refmac?

   o filechooser in save mode doesnt have delete & rename file!? Shall/can we?!

   o refinement weighting by occupancy

   o running shelx should be 'threaded'

   o add all GtkWidget and similar functions as ignore to coot.i (script)

   o simulate middle mouse with Alt left ?!

04/10/08
   o simultaneous refinement of alt confs

   o interface to thomas schneider superposition program (ESCET)

   o rigid body fit per residues (* done? bb script?! No! extend to nulceotides
	i.e. use sugar and base as rb)

   o fix OXT refinement
     (maybe not now, as it may be fixed with MODRES etc... certainly already better)

   o density histogram graph?!
   o calculate/display skew of map

   o additional representations: hide parts of model (use bond thickness 0?!?
	bond thickness 0 doesnt work. hiding seems tricky!?

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are) use openGL matrices?!

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation/sloopy)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o high resolution auto-build

14/08/08
   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?) Done?

16/09/08
   o 'new', short display manager

22/09/08

   o notes to self:
     - ribbons: include ribbons
  		save the ribbons for later use (?, maybe better to update and generate new)
		sort out colouring
        get lighting sorted
		use CMMDBManager somehow...
     - ccp4mg ellipsoids

low importance

* add rcrane reference



**** Python ****

   o if there is no python scripting. Dont load python scripts etc.

   o add other solvent molecule -> dont import cif again?!

   o residue type selection convert to upper case (maybe best a combobox)

   o find_exe/command_in_path

  for found/defined exes

   o export COOT_PYTHON_DIR

* Done? but useful? CHECK

   o make variables e.g. ROTAMERSEARCHMODE... work to be set
	not possible I think. Cannot overload function/variable in python

   o enable PISA interface for new enough PISA

   o rethink threading - maybe better integration in event loop possible?

   o check output libraries/cifs from libcheck, esp from smiles

   o update documentation (tags); make extra file with title?!

   o different 'Control_' spellings in key board shortcuts

   o write proper path in state file if file is absolute (i.e. include drive letter)

   o fix find-ligand (and maybe others) for use in Windows. Arg parsing not
	working on MinGW (maybe DOS?)

   o write some info in registry to see that WinCoot is actually installed
	together with version info etc maybe

   o make install syminfo.lib from windows dir

   o use fftw binaries

   o write installer to registry/installed programs etc.

   o load pdb problem with space and/or umlaut in path!?

   o new gtk chooser sometimes only displaysrecent files rather than all

(* Done - optional compress that is, make entry in preferences?)

   o better python std flushing for MINGW

   o update WinCoot to guile 1.8.6 (if possible)

   o simple guile implementation in WinCoot

   o windows build: dont update src tar whilst building (if possible)
