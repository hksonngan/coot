* THINGS TO DO BEFORE 0.6.2 RELEASE * ONLY URGENT THING
-------------------------------------------------------

notes APS CCP4 workshop
- document refmac extra params + lib files location (note to self ?!)
- SF4 library file (for Garib at some point)

----------------
* TO DO THINGS *
----------------

**** General ****

   o enable Alt key for scripting keyboard shortcuts

   o reset button for map sharpening

   o water check for B below threshold?!

   o Tooltips for residues in new sequence view?! (wait for goocanvas - has
	build-in tooltip)

   o Edit Chi for hydrogens not working (H from reduce at least)

   o transform whole asu for packing comparision?!

   o doublication of find strand/find ss (Extensions, Other tools)

   o glycosylate residue

04/11/08 CCP4 dev meeting:
   o activate bulk solvent correction for refmac?

   o filechooser in save mode doesnt have delete & rename file!? Shall/can we?!

   o refinement weighting by occupancy

   o running shelx should be 'threaded'

   o add all GtkWidget and similar functions as ignore to coot.i (script)

   o simulate middle mouse with Alt left ?!

04/10/08
   o simultaneous refinement of alt confs

   o interface to thomas schneider superposition program (ESCET)

   o rigid body fit per residues (* done? bb script?! No! extend to nulceotides
	i.e. use sugar and base as rb)

   o fix OXT refinement
     (maybe not now, as it may be fixed with MODRES etc... certainly already better)

   o density histogram graph?!

   o additional representations: hide parts of model (use bond thickness 0?!?
	bond thickness 0 doesnt work. hiding seems tricky!?

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are)

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation/sloopy)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o high resolution auto-build

14/08/08
   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?) Done?

16/09/08
   o 'new', short display manager

22/09/08
   o fix size of chooser dialog (if possible, gtk2 bug?!)


   o notes to self:
     - ribbons: include ribbons
  		save the ribbons for later use (?, maybe better to update and generate new)
		sort out colouring
        get lighting sorted
		use CMMDBManager somehow...
     - ccp4mg ellipsoids


**** Python ****

   o different 'Control_' spellings in key board shortcuts

   o remove trailing space for EBI/downloaded file names

   o make all 'macros' (e.g. with_auto_accept) to use all sort of input
	(list, args, ... - cf using_active_atom)

   o refmac warning when no freeR (how to detect?!)

   o document remote connection

   o make a server-client swapped version for remote control (if possible)

   o fix 'No Adjustment' buttons (and callbacks) in user_mods_gui

   o review pygtk button (and other) callbacks which are string, poss can be 
	exchanged (see water_coordination_gui)

   o optional tooltips for main toolbar buttons

   o fix addition of guile and python keybindings (translation of lambda functions?)

   o key code for '(' and ')' not recognised (on FC10 e.g.)

   o update python WIKI scripts

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check (*Done?!)

   o make guile-gtk properly gtk2 complient (esp. text-view) or wait for
     proper gnome-guile


**** Windows ****

   o icon on WinCoot website

   o label main Window WinCoot

   o check save times with gz compression, maybe make optional (feels slow)

   o better python std flushing for MINGW

   o update WinCoot to guile 1.8.6 (if possible)

   o simple guile implementation in WinCoot

   o windows build: dont update src tar whilst building (if possible)

   o merge build-it-win with buid-it-gtk2-simple?!

   o WinCoot:
    - update gtk? Better for Windows 7?!
	- before stable release copy python over
	- silent python installation? Possible? (http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/)

   o A comprehensive windows test system(?):	
                - start XP for testing after installer build
				- install WinCoot silent
				- download test data and unittests
				- run tests
				- send email about status/or notify otherwise


---------------
* DONE THINGS *
---------------

   o labelling with 'l' doesnt show status bar info (feature/bug?)

* Done

   o fix using_active_atom with respect to lists
	.. and extra args

*Done
