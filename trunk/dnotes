      Things to add or fix before 0.4


   o Do the strand restraints work well under refinement?

   o Try again to add chiral volumes to the geometry target function

   o Alice Dawson SSM Problem, 1pyd.  Message sent to Eugene -
     He says no problem.  Therefore small example program is required
     to find the problem in SSM (or elsewhere of course).

   o Frank's SSM crash.

   o Don't display symmetry with hydrogens if the main molecule
     doesn't have them [Steven Graham]

   o Post-install slim the binaries

   o Test Cootaneer by building from just a map.

   o Build against new clipper (delete clipper from all autobuild trees).

   o Check where else we do a SetSpaceGroup().  Bug there too?

   o Where else do I mess with the space group like I did at the end of 
     unshelxing?  Fix that too.

   o Fix non-orthorhombic aniso Us.

   o Correct CISPEP if needed cards on writing pdb.
     Hand off to Eugene for now.

   o res098 from Lionel Colliandre - alt conf occ resetting problem on
     regularize. 

   o "Environment distances that label everything" - David Briggs

   o Carsten's Map Masking crash





   o Richardson rotamers

* Done.

   o history doesn't quote set-display-intro-string and
     handle-read-draw-molecule-with-recentre - it should.

* Done.

   o Activate test suite

* Done.

   o Fix Cootaneer crash

* Done.  It was a problem in trim_atom_label_table().

   o Multiple models overlapping does not delete the non-best fitting
     models. It should.

* It does - I don't know why I thought that it didn't.  Hmm...

   o specify default working molecule for water addition (esp. for
     key-bound water addition) [JED]

* Done.  You need to set it using "Place Atom at Pointer" molecule
  chooser (then Cancel that dialog).

   o are the findwaters and findligands being installed correctly
     (with wrappers?).  Get a pre-release tar ball and look at that.

* Seems fine.  Ask eleanor to run it on the command line

   o Make the Omega Angle Plot update properly in
     update_geometry_graphs()

* Done.

   o C key press in the graphics runs the graphics-general-key-press-hook.  
     It should not.

* Fixed.

   o When refining, add a status bar message that describes the Ctrl
     button usage.

* Done. 

   o Is there a memory problem in unshelx?  Valgrind it, I suppose.

* Yes, there was.  Messing with copying the Space group name.  No need
  SetSpaceGroup() does a string copy.

   o try read phs, read a pdb to get cell, pdb file does not have cell
     -> crash. 	deliang chen <deliangc@uci.edu>
       Subject: 	Re: [ccp4bb] Wincoot 0.3.3(Zeta) crash help
       Date: 	Fri, 27 Jul 2007 00:26:26 +0200  (Thu, 23:26 BST)

* Seems OK under valgrind - a WinCoot bug?

   o Crash report by "Gajiwala, Ketan": CR in graphics after Acc/Rej
     was deleted.

* Fixed.

   o Get B factors from shelx Us (for B factor variance plot)

* Done.

   o Crash report by "Gajiwala, Ketan": CR in graphics after Acc/Rej
     was deleted.

* Fixed (I guess).

   o re-work the cootaneering gui, use a sub-menu.

* Done.

   o Ignore hydrogens in B-factor variance plot

* Done     

   o auto-read-shelx-project: check if fcf is more recent than fcf.cif
     before auto-loading fcf.cif

* Done.

   o Add a PIR sequence reader for cootaneering

* Done.

   o Add select by sphere to test suite

* Done.

   o Add planar peptide restraints as default

* Done.

   o Add Chiral centre inversion and cis peptide generation check 
     after refinement or regularization.

     - move bad_chiral_volumes() to coot-coord-extras and use it to
     check chiral volumes after refinement (i.e. we should get a
     warning info_dialog on top of (displayed after) the Accept/Reject
     dialog. 

* Actually, simple-restraint.cc was the right place because coot-utils
  are low level and don't use simple-restraint.hh

     Also test a mmdb for a cis peptide.  Add that function to
     coot-coord-utils.hh 
	
     std::vector<std::pair<coot::residue_spec_t, coot::residue_spec_t> > 
	test_for_cis_peptides(CMMDBManager *fragment_mol);

* Done - I'm not sure I like the way the dialogs work... but perhaps
  too much warning is better than not enough?

   o Gtk Timeout for reading socket strings

* Done in 0.3.2 in fact.

   o Select residues (for new molecule) by sphere

* Done

   o Multiple model ligand overlaying

* Done.

   o Cootaneer

* Done.

   o fix db-main so that it doesn't spew error messages

* Done.  Trivial

   o unshelxing is interfering with go to atom from lst file reader.
     How about this cunning plan:  
     (shelx-lst-conversion-func imol) returns a function that takes
     the lst residue number as an arg and returns a (list chain-id
     resno).  The body of the returned func will depend on the output
     of unshelx().

    CMMDBManager *unshelx(CMMDBManager *mol);
    need to also return mapping info
    vector of 
    [input_threash -> (chain-id resno-offset)]
    i.e. if residue_num >= input_threash we have a given chain-id and
    resno offset.
    run over all sets of [input_threash -> (chain-id resno-offset)] to get the 
    correct offset

* Done.

wget libtool-1.5.22.tar.gz
cd libtoo-1.5.22
./configure --prefix=$prfx

make install

wget guile-1.8.1.tar.gz
cd guile-1.8.1
./configure --prefix=$prfx CFLAGS=-I$prfx/include LDFLAGS=-L$prfx/lib
# on cycle at least, we need to stop the optimization:
./configure --prefix=$prfx "CFLAGS=-I$prfx/include -g" LDFLAGS=-L$prfx/lib
make 
make install

wget guile-gtk-2.0.tar.gz
cd guile-gtk-2.0
./configure --prefix=$prfx --without-gtkgl

 --------
  
   Things to fix before 0.3.2

   o Change the Release notes, 
     the ChangeLog, 
     configure.in (obviously)
     old coot timer


   o Ramachandran Plot and Kleywegt Plot interact badly causing crash.

* Fixed.  Simply we can't have both.

   o Fix the carriage return on Check Delete waters result.  It should
     do a next button, not a click on the OK button.

* Easy fix - done in glade.

   o set-map-display, set-mol-displayed, set-mol-active.  Do they
     properly toggle the buttons in the Display Manager?  They should.

* They didn't.  They do now.  It worked first time :)

   o Fix the File-name filter: in script file reading

* Done.

   o Sort out the Cholesky decomposition.  Question to self: what are
     the matrices that are being decomposed, exactly?
     
     Good question.  That broke the back of the problem actually.  I
     compared thox.pdb Us with thos.res Us and found they were
     different (a transposition).  Now U matrix principal minors are
     checked before cholesky decomposition is performed.

 * Done!

   o mainchain zone, reverse dir, mainchain zone, screwed mainchain

* Done.

   o residue range was inserted into the wrong place in the pdb file

* Done.

   o copy fragment, residue range miss - feedback required.

* Done.

   o optionally animate fit-waters

* Done.

   o Mask map should have an inversion check button.

* Done.

   o Kleywegt plots don't update properly when not specifying chains.

* Done.

   o Saving in another directory - remember the save dir for next
     molecule to be saved.

* Done.

   o copy fragment, residue range miss - feedback required.

* Done.     

   o Disappearing NCS ghosts on changing NCS master 

     Also:

	Coot behaves differently depending on which chain I've chosen
	as the "master". When A is master, I can click the display box
	on/off and it simply displays (or hides) the ghost chains with
	no fuss. However, if I chosen a different chain as master,
	then each time I turn the ghosts on it recalculates the entire
	alignment.

* Done.

   o Thick bonds do not get set/groked in state file - they should be.

* Done.

   o transform-map

* Done.

   o Multiple coordinate molecules, inconsistent when starting up go
     to atom window.  Residue tree not same molecule as molecule
     chooser.  It only fails on startup.

* Fixed.

   o Do residue refinement after nucleotide add terminal residue (or
     can it be done trivially using the same mechanism as
     add-terminal-resdue-do-post-refine?

* Man, that was hard work.  Needed nucleotide to nucleotide function

   o Bad logic in setting display/active for molecules (Bob Nolte bug)

        If I turn on the display manager in my .coot file, and then
        load a coot state file which toggles off some of the loaded
        structures, the display manager gets confused and shows the
        wrong state.

* Fixed.

   o fix this:

	Kevin was doing some building and Coot lost the spacegroup.
	Adding UNK terminal residues
	Reversing the chain direction (probably this one?)
	db-main for new mainchain

* Done. Trival error in transfering spacegroup string.  Fixed malloc
  error in show-spacegroup while debugging this, which was much more
  important.

   o Stereo buttons need to be fixed

       Need to check that wall and cross eyes work

* Done.

   o Fix text widget in Sequence reading code (e.g. Fit Loop)

* Done.

   o Residue Info edits not being applied

* Done.

   o Delete a View number

* Done.

   o Save views to view file.

* Done.

   o Ramachandran plot window should remember where it was put

* Done.

   o Colour by B-factor

* Done

   o Colour by occupancy

* Done

   o Fix text widget in About 

* Done.

   o Alt confs fly apart in regularization of ligands.

* Done.

   o CNS map reading

* Done.

   o CNS data reading

* Kevin says leave it.  Fine.

   o Juergen's bad map

* Hand off to Kevin, bad map.

   o Put a file selector on the shelxl refine interface.

* Done.

   o Spin View 

* Done.

   How should "Check for updates" work.

   In scheme, of course

   It should know the current coot-version

   It needs to get the latest stable relesed version and 
   the release notes for that.

   So the release notes should be on the web site.  I think that they
   are...

   So it needs to get the current stable release version (a string)
   from the web site.  How shall that be done?

      get the stable release binary list web page.  Search as we do
      for the latest coot version as we do in the build-it file (that
      involves awk).

   Then, if there is a new release, get the release notes file and put
   the contents into a scrolled text window.

	User pickable atoms:

	a function that registers interest in n atom selections and a
	function to call when it has them.  We test in
	graphics-info-defines whether such a function exists and has
	all the number of picks that it needs, if it does and it
	doesn't then collect them and pass them on when it has all
	it needs.  When the function has been called delete it from
	the queue/vector of such functions (umm, better do the
	deletion just before the function call so that if there is an
	error in the scm function we don't jump away from the function
	deletion part).

Christopher Rife:

   I've noticed that when using "NCS Control" in Coot, it behaves
   differently depending on which chain I've chosen as the
   "master". When A is master, I can click the display box on/off and
   it simply displays (or hides) the ghost chains with no
   fuss. However, if I chosen a different chain as master, then each
   time I turn the ghosts on it recalculates the entire
   alignment. This is rather cumbersome with large structures...

   o Merge a fragment, change chain ids by residue range (40-50)

   o The GoTo Atom residue tree looks messed up (nothing beyond 50)

   on writing out the PBD file, residue 50 is in the right place, but
   40-49 have been writen to the end of the chain.  Which causes the
   problem in the Go To Atom window.

* Fixed.

   Fitting a helix in a low resolution and low level (0.02 e) map.  

   Density looked reasonable for a helix, but was rejected on CB
   density.

   Should the be less strict for CB density at lower resolutions? 
   What is the cut-off criteria for CB density?

* There was a hard-wired cut off 0.2 in the helix fitting.  Make
  variable and moved upstairs to the invoking function.

  It's currently tedious to make a native patterson.  So add an option
  to do it for me.  You'll have to change the space group to have the
  symmetry of the Patterson and make up a column of zeros for the phase.

   Problem with doing Randy's sidebyside screen update:

   to solve his problem we want to 
	draw(glarea1)
	draw(glarea2)
	swap_buffers(glarea1)
	swap_buffers(glarea2)

   so we have to move swap_buffers *out* of the draw() function. 

   OK, I did that.

   The problem now is with the expose_event callback.

   the expose event callback is what is used by draw()

   urgh.

* Anyway, fixed now.

  Steven Graham:

     I had just another minor quibble with coot... If one reads in a
     molecule with hydrogens in the PDB file, and one turns the
     display of hydrogens off using 'Edit > Bond Parameters', any
     symmetry-related molecules that are drawn still have protons
     displayed.

     Is there an easy way to not display protons for symmetry
     molecules?

  This is a bug. 

  Priority: High.

	I was testing sphere atoms.  I had pointer distances up.  I
	going to delete atoms to count them.  Mabye I labelled lots of
	atoms.  I guess I had a go to atom up (maybe not).

	I fired up Delete, changed to delete water, keep active.

	I clicked on an atom

	Boom, crash.

OK, here's how to reproduce:

	start from 0crash.scm
        add pointer distances
	Fire up Go to atom
	Close with top right WM button
	Delete, Delete Atom, Active
	Click an atom
	Crash.

  I find the option to use the directories and projects i have defined
  for ccp4i in the coot file-selection menus rather VERY useful. now
  it turns out i do have quite a few projects defined in ccp4, and the
  list runs off the bottom of my screen in coot (while ccp4 breaks it
  over and starts a second column and a third ...). any chance ... ???

  and while you are at it ... would you still have an option to also
  use ccp4 aliases in coot on your 'to think about' list ? this would
  be quite a luxury ... you once said this might be possible ...

* Done.

  ehem ... another idea ... would anybody else be interested in having
  a button to undisplay ALL maps at once in the display menu pop-up
  ???

* A bit of scripting can do this (done).

   How about some flexibility in file name output?


     How difficult is it to create (or, maybe, How would one go about
     creating a) naming system for output PDB files that is consonant
     with my usage?  Currently COOT gives a default of
     input_file_name-coot-0.pdb.  I typically name my files
     model_0i.pdb for the file out of refinement (before ligand, hence
     the zero -- yes I do it too ;-) ) and my first output file as
     model_0o1.pdb.  If I do some "editing" outside of COOT, I might
     then create model_0i2.pdb and if I make some changes inside COOT,
     the output file would be model_0o2.pdb, etc.  After the next
     cycle of refinement, I would come in with model_1i.pdb, etc.

    atoms of the copy a bit.

    Merge those molecules.

    Make a copy:
    Do a lsq of C in the copy to A in the copy. capture the matrix.
    (apply add-ncs-matrix rna-mol "C" "A" matrix)

    Show NCS ghosts - are they there?

* Done.

   after lsqing a copy and saving state

   on reading the state filel at startup, it says there are 2 pdbs in
   the state file, but only one gets loaded.

	how about adding assign-pir-sequence to the state file?
	Problem is we don't store raw input, just the decoded sequence.
	We need both.
	something should be std::pair<std::string, std::string (orig, seq)
	not just std::string

        Hmm... perhaps a simple class then, because we need a flag to
        say that this molecule has a sequence assigned to it.

	currently we do an atom selection and a rebonding (and redraw)
	for each atom attribute.

Sat Aug  4 15:22:06 BST 2007

        using multiple-set-atom-attribute will get rid of the
        intermediate rebonding and drawing.  How much will that speed
        things up (we still are doing the individual atom selections).

The Novell SUSE Linux subscription model is considerably less painful,
Chevalier argues, because it doesn't hit the capital expense budget
and it can often be considered an operational expense, which is better
from a tax perspective.

   Thoughts for a tutorial or some such.

   "Assessing structure quality with Coot"
    (in response to EJD's comments on CCP4bb 2hr0)

    Structure with 0 occupancy

	What is a good (bad) Ramachandran?
	    
            What is a bad Kleywegt plot?
	
	Good (bad) geometry graph.

	Chiral volume outliers

	Cis-peptides, planar peptide restraints

	Good density fit graph (and how to scale it)

	Nomenclature errors in rotamers - and how to fix them
	   Missing atoms

	How to use with Molprobity (web output and local exes)

	B-factor variance.  What's good and bad.
	
   Priority: Low


-----
Tue Aug 21 14:44:14 BST 2007

	Note to self:

	B factor average, variance vs resolution for each residue type.

	Probably best to have a shell script to provide the pdb files
	
	c++ program reads pdbs and does b-factor analysis, 

            on completion appends to files "ARG.tab" "ASP.tab" etc
            with average and variance for each residue of that type in
            that pdb file.  Also the resolution.

	    only do 1 chain of each pdb file.

            use Coot libs - make it a Coot program.
