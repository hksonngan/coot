   How about some flexibility in file name output?

     How difficult is it to create (or, maybe, How would one go about
     creating a) naming system for output PDB files that is consonant
     with my usage?  Currently COOT gives a default of
     input_file_name-coot-0.pdb.  I typically name my files
     model_0i.pdb for the file out of refinement (before ligand, hence
     the zero -- yes I do it too ;-) ) and my first output file as
     model_0o1.pdb.  If I do some "editing" outside of COOT, I might
     then create model_0i2.pdb and if I make some changes inside COOT,
     the output file would be model_0o2.pdb, etc.  After the next
     cycle of refinement, I would come in with model_1i.pdb, etc.

	Note to self:

	B factor average, variance vs resolution for each residue type.

	Probably best to have a shell script to provide the pdb files
	
	c++ program reads pdbs and does b-factor analysis, 

            on completion appends to files "ARG.tab" "ASP.tab" etc
            with average and variance for each residue of that type in
            that pdb file.  Also the resolution.

	    only do 1 chain of each pdb file.

            use Coot libs - make it a Coot program.

    We shall use a std::vector<line_representation> line_rep_vec;  
    New items are pushed back.  You can't delete an item from this
    vector, mearly not display it (the handles are passed back - and
    we don't want them to go out of date).

    Particular alt confs cannot be selected for.

    Questions:  How shall we create new represenations for this molecule?

    // return 
    int add_representation imol represenation-spec

    // used by GUI
    undisplay_represenation imol respresentation-number

    undisplay_represenation imol residue_spec
    which needs to be unambiguated. Test in this order:

     o Was there a line_representation that has that residue_spec?
     o Was there a residue_range line_representation that encompassed that residue_spec?
     o Was that residue in a chain that has a line_representation?

"My view is that I don't want to see all 3 of these in the list, one would do. "

    One can see something similar if you peak search the difference

    done in scripting of course, now (not sure if that is for the
    best)

---
Sun Jan 13 14:51:14 GMT 2008

   In ligand fitting, I want to see the scores and the positions of
   the best fits in the other orientations.  The B factors should be
   set to the ligand fit score for this testing.  Perhaps the ligand
   fitting should return a vector of std::pair<name, mol>s.  Best fit,
   ori1, ori2, etc.

   So maybe set a developer option to do this.

   Residue info should also contain phi psi values and a percentile
   (like molprobity)

   How about a graph of Ramachandran percentile?

    How To Add Another Geometry Graph
  
    in geometry_graphs.hh:
    --------------------------
    Add new type to geometry_graph_type 

    in geometry_graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    In the coot::geometry_graphs::geometry_graphs(...) constructor, add title

    in graphics-info-graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    graphics_info_t::update_geometry_graphs(...) 
    Add a function to update new graph.

      coot::geometry_graphs *gr =
	 geometry_graph_dialog_to_object(residue_density_fit_graph[imol_moving_atoms]);
	 std::vector<coot::geometry_graph_block_info_generic> dv =
	    geomtry_graph_xxx_from_mol(moving_atoms_asc_local,
				 imol_moving_atoms,
				 Imol_Refinement_Map());
	 gr->update_residue_blocks(dv);

    Create a function:
    void graphics_info_t::xxx_graphs(int imol)...


    in c-interface-xxx.cc
    ----------------------
      void validation_graph_XXX_mol_selector_activate (GtkMenuItem     *menuitem,
						      gpointer         user_data);
   in main.cc
   ----------
   Add create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic
   The menu name (the first string) must match the names generated by the glade

   in callbacks.c
   --------------
  char *type = "density-fit";
  GtkWidget *menu = lookup_widget(GTK_WIDGET(menuitem), "density_fit_analysis1");
  if (menu) { 
    add_on_validation_graph_mol_options(menu, type);
  } else { 
    printf("failed to get menu in on_density_fit1_activate\n");
  }
    
   in c-interface-validate.cc
   -------------------------

   Add another option to add_on_validation_graph_mol_options()

   The validation_type must match that from callbacks.c
   The sub_menu_name must match that from main.cc 
     create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic()

   Also unset_geometry_graph(GtkWidget *dialog) needs to know about the new graph

   in graphics_info_graphs.cc 
   --------------------------
   set_validation_graph need to know about the new graph

    Really test out Ca Zone -> Mainchain.  

    It seems to me that most of the time it works well, but there are
    regions where it does not. e.g. CA - N bonds of less than 0.5A.
    I am thinking that that can only be coming from a bug.

    Think about how to test that. 

    Very few reference structures?

    We need to know how many fragment are contributing to each
    position.

    Now I am compiling gtk2+ becuase the system gtk2+ on cycle (FC4)
    is too old to complile Coot.

    I am doing it on cycle in ~/compile
    I created setup pango-glib-gtk2 with PKG_CONFIG settings.
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4

    glib 2.12.13 straightforward
    pango 1.16.4 straightforward
    fine.  
    Oh for gtk2 though, cairo is not an option.  It is a must.  Baah.
    That was not clear in www.gtk.org.

    So get cairo 1.4.14 from http://cairographics.org/releases/

    which means get glitz from http://cairographics.org/snapshots/
    (gotta have glitz, right?)

    glitz-0.5.6 
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4 --enable-glitz
    This displays a warning about using glitz, but configures OK.
    Compiles OK.

    back to pango:
    now with cairo in place, pango's configure finds cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to Gtk2+:
    glib version test failed, so need to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH too (to the setup file)
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Fine.  But Coot configure fails on gtlglExt

    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtkglext/gtkglext-1.2.0.tar.gz?modtime=1139081517&big_mirror=1
    back to GtkGLExt:
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Coot now compiles OK.  And runs! Great.
    But - it doesn't load svgs.

    OK, back-up. 

    config.log for cairo tells us we need a newer librsvg:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/librsvg-2.20.0.tar.gz (2 days old at 
    time of writting)

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Warns us that we are not compiling with libcroco.
    Oh well.

    OK, now librsvg is in place configure finds it.
    Rebuilding cairo
    Install.

    Fine.  Now coot loads its svgs.  Yay!

    PyGtk needs pycairo


    Correct build order:
    glitz
    glib
    librsvg
    cairo
    pango
    gtk+-2
    glkglext

Hmm...


checking for LIBRSVG... configure: error: Package requirements (        gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 1.3.7         glib-2.0 >= 2.12.0      libxml-2.

Requested 'pangoft2 >= 1.2.0' but version of Pango FT2 is 1.1.1

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/cairo.html

  Note that the GTK, Poppler and librsvg packages are circular in that
  using them for test suite coverage requires installing cairo first,
  then installing the desired package(s), then installing cairo again.

 Use cluster volume vs contour threshhold plot (of the difference map)

    When you do LSQ superpositions in COOT, can you make it so that if

    Frank: 

   "torsion general - crappy tail?"  I think I meant: why can't one
   use torsion general to swing a whole lot of protein around a main
   chain bond?  If I try, the mouse just clears after the 4th click.
   i.e., all I can move around is a miserable little tail of a
   sidechain, maybe.  Oh wait, I see now: yes, torsion general works
   only inside a residue.  Which is a bit anal, what if I want to
   swivel a whole domain or helix when it's changed from the MR model.
   Other place of nuisance: when modelling around in poor density at
   the end of a chain.

   "Ramachandran boundaries".  Ah yes: any reason why you don't have
   the same smooth boundaries that Richardsons use?  I've seen cases
   just outside your boundaries, but happily inside the Richardson
   one.

   "Views file: #Views".  Yes, the views file coot writes out itself
   doesn't load back.  Reason is (I remember) that the second (or
   third line) contains #Views, which screws up scheme.

   "Save coords: most recently changed".  Oh yes: could you populate
   the defaults (molecule; filename) based on the file most recently
   changed, and not on the one currently active?  These are not always
   the same, and chances are I want to save what I just built at, not
   what I was looking at.

Randy Read: 
Some time back I sent you a bug report about split-screen stereo.  Don't know 
if you've been able to reproduce it, but since then I've worked out the 
problems.  Basically, coot doesn't like the "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)" option 
any more.  Part of the problem is the saved state.  If the saved state is 
Mono or normal "Side by Side", then you're fine -- coot comes up the way you 
left it.  (Don't know about hardware, as I don't have access to an 
appropriate machine.)  If the saved state is "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)", then 
Draw -> Stereo... brings up a box claiming that you're still in that mode, 
but the view is a mono one.  The only way to get wall-eyed stereo from this 
state is to click "Mono" then "Side by Side" then finally "Side by Side (Wall 
Eyed)".  If you come up in Mono mode, you also can't go directly to 
wall-eyed -- first you have to go into normal side-by-side mode.

Lothar Esser

I am using coot 0.5 pre 958 and noticed that after resizing the
window of the ramachandran plot and possibly zooming in (with the
right mouse) the scroll bars don't allow to pan over the plot. Only
under extreme zoom, the scroll bars allow a little bit of
adjustment. I have over 2000 residues and need to zoom and scroll a
bit if I want to click on residues.

I do get error messages on the
terminal that might help:

** CRITICAL **: file gtk-canvas.c: line 3518
** (gtk_canvas_set_pixels_per_unit): a ssertion `n >
** GTK_CANVAS_EPSILON' failed.

The same message repeats presumably every
time I scroll(?) or perphas zoom.

Also, I noticed after a long search that the -key zooms out after I
had zoomed in with the right-mouse. Could zooming out be added to the
mouse perhaps like Shift-right-mouse ?

Another feature of coot would be good: Show ramachandran plots by
chains that the user select i.e. a plot with one chain at a time.

  Sugar puckers

     RNA sugar pucker (C3' endo or C2' endo) is strongly correlated to
     the perpendicular distance between the following (3') phosphate
     and either the plane of the base or the C1'-N1/9 glycosidic bond
     vector. Incorrectly chosen sugar puckers also often result in
     out-of-range values for the epsilon dihedral. This is important
     information, because a sugar pucker is very difficult to
     determine directly from the electron density at resolutions
     typical for large RNAs. MolProbity checks epsilon angles and
     checks the modeled sugar pucker against the base-phosphate
     distance; it flags outliers as potentially having the wrong
     pucker.

    Fun: How about a script to make ray traced images of ligands at

    have different ligands).  Need to find structures with data of
    course.  Consider using j-multi-read, get the matrices and apply
    them to their maps.  Maybe that is not needed, because we are not
    going to look at the overlapped maps anyway, just ligands in the
    binding sites.

    Data needs to be formatted differently in the
    text control file - we need a specification of the mtz file and
    column labels too.

    Reasons why the builds fail:

    o because the sourceforge host for the gtkglext package disappeared

    o Ran out of memory, causing the compiler to crash (I'd forgotten

    o Forgotten to add new files to the svn repo

    Note: Processes for automated builds/testing

 o The process that checks out the latest sources, compiles the code
   and publishes a source tar file, the build log (for building
   problems) and build-from-source success status

 o The build+test+tar+(copies+)publish process itself - build-it, runs
   on all up to hosts several times a day

 o The process that cleans up the build directory - every day, deletes
   everthing more than 7 day old

 o The process that deletes "old" pre-release build tar files from the
   web - runs every day, deleting everything more than 30 days old

 o The process that makes a web page from the build results - runs
   every 5 minutes, examining results from fedrated builds

	It's not the algorithms

   After the release, there are no pre-release source tars, so the
   build web page builder fails (a list-ref of a #f list)

   Python 2.5.2 build tests are failing with sendmail on FC5 (after
   re-install?)

   Crash on CentOS 4 machines when trying to read svgs

   Trying to separate python build logs from non-python build
   logs. Problems! overlapping dependencies, test the tar file and
   transfer it - many fixes to sort out.

   Coot builds on 32 and 64 bit systems.  In which directory should
   the libraries go?  By convention, 32 bit libs in prefix/lib and 64
   bit libs in prefix/lib64.  How is this sorted out in the configure?
   Buy using an autoconf macro AC_LIB_PREPARE_MULTILIB.  Where is this
   provided? In a recent version of gettext (more recent that fink
   currently provides).  So on every build system we have to get (e.g
   from the pre-build package e.g. Ubuntu intrepid) or downlaod and
   install gettext manually and point the autogen (that run aclocal and
   autoconf) to use the macros in the files installed from gettext.

   I wanted to check that the torsions in ligand conformation were
   being correctly set.  I needed a function therefore to return a
   torsion to the scripting level - given a set of atom specifiers.
   So first a wrote a test that tested that the torsion generation
   function worked - did it fail properly when the (some of) the atoms
   were not correctly specified (i.e. not in the molecule).  When that
   was working, I could write a test to do the ligand fitting and
   check the torsions of the best fitting (hopefully correctly
   fitting) model.

Sat Oct 25 03:11:07 BST 2008

  In the conformer generation, generate many models first, then
  select the top N for energy minimization.

  Instead of search the maps for ligand sites, try to position the
  ligand at a give postion (e.g. the screen centre). 

  Try a 27 pt box search around the centre position.  Try different
  rigid body angles at the box points.

   Frank:

     This one is quicker: are you able to colour text in the Display
     Manager?  In which case it would be handy to have the text for
     the map objects coloured according to map type, e.g. blue for
     sigmaA map, red for difference map (info you can infer from the
     mtz?), and even green for other maps (usually
     experimental/averaged).

   Yes, except use the background color, I think.  And how about a
   button that is half red, half green?

   In make_link_restraints() we need to make sure that we are sensibly

   Where is the test that these residues are L-peptides? in
   add_rama()?  No.  So it should be in make_rama_triples() then.
   Perhaps.  But it should be somewhere.

   Conversation with Ed:
 
  o Nice to have ^S bound to Save Coords (Add accelerator to gui)

  o Can you generate "arrow key-press events" from rotating the
  PowerMate?  Surely yes, it's just a matter of getting the power mate
  in the mode to generate the characters.  Ah.. but no, the powermate
  can generate 3 key presses basically (in Bills example, F1, F2, F3)

   Hmm...

  o What about binding PowerMate to chi angle motion - which is moving
    the mouse a bit.  Surely we can do that?

* Yes we can.
