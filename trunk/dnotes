   Things to fix before 0.5

   22 Items

   o Test for non positive definite anisotropic atoms from a .ins file
     [test should crash, Mitch Miller, Stanford]

* Can't reproduce   

   o "Thick bonds" for ligands etc

   o Kevin's Ramachandran Refinement target

   o Correct CISPEP if needed cards on writing pdb.

   o PDB v3.0 compatibility

   o Use Eugene's new LINK-reading code.

   o Fix this:  
      ./configure: line 26927: ./po/POTFILES.in: No such file or directory
      (it comes from building from the tar file)

* No problem on penelope, gtk.  It is a problem on dragon (or was it braggn?).

   o The default occupancy for new atoms in a shelx molecule should be
     11.0.  Is it? [JED]

* It is, but the residue number is "1" and the SFAC index is -1.  Bad.

   o Valgrind long/multiple fit-proteins

   o Revisit CCP4mg button

   o test/fix hardware stereo in Gtk2 mode.

   o NCS Ligands: if we find a ligand C in molecule A, we should look
     for a similar blob near molecule B and try to fit the same kind of
     ligand there as well [JED]

   o How about a post-swig command to add #ifdef USE_PYTHON around 
     coot_wrap_python.cc (or is it coot_wrap_python_pre.cc?)

   o Check Richardson Rotatmer library is correctly used for GLN, ASN, PRO.
     Ask about Rotamer misses.  Well, the dictionary is fine. Why does
     molprobity web site gives less bad rotamers then? (First: Does it?).
     Yes it does: e.g. for 1sar molprobity notes only these:
     "Bad rotamer B  47 GLN (0.3%)" 
     "Bad rotamer A  91 LEU (0.4%)" 
     "Bad rotamer A  13 PRO (0.9%)" 
     "Bad rotamer B  41 GLU (0.7%)" 

     There are 10 times more for Coot.  
     (fix-nomenclature-errors doesn't fix anything)

   o doing a flexible ligand fit in a ligands without flexible bonds -
     e.g. SO4 gives non-optimal message ("Did you forget to read the
     dictionary?").

   o Update stand-alone refinement program. 
     (Write a test for it?)

   o Upgrade to guile-1.8.3.  Does that fix the greg child process
     problem?  If not, mail list.

   o Try to improve the picking algorithm.






   o Insertion codes for intelligent next atom.  Antibody, Kabat

* Done.

   o Test for JED's delete residue with alt conf and recentre [test
     should crash]

* Fixed.

   o NCS diffs graph need finishing.  Almost there.  Needs code to do
     dynamic update.

* Done.  Needs testing.  Does it dynamically update?

   o Save symmetry colour to state (Doug Kuntz).  When the slider
     moves, it should update the graphics

   o Fix problem of ccp4i project open menu (for maps? certainly on
     Select Coordiantes File.)

* Done.

   o Fixed atoms in refinement (and marking in molecules).  Code needs
     finishing.  mark_atom_as_fixed()

* Done.  Refinement sometimes unstable, sadly.

   o graphics::molecules should be a std::vector

* Done.  Yay!

   o Make build-it-gtk2 and use it.

* Done.

   o Mutate should not change the order of the atoms in the pdb.
     http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/latest/atom-format.html

     "For amino acids, the traditional order of atom records within a
     residue is N, CA, C, O, followed by the sidechain atoms (CB, CG1,
     CG2 . . . ) in order first of increasing remoteness, and then
     branch. The extra oxygen at the carboxyl terminal is called "
     OXT", and appears after all sidechain atoms."

* Done.

   o Fix Charlie Bond's shelx ins writing bug ("shelx woe", 10 sept 2007)

* Done.  Sort of.  It writes a file now at least.  What more do you want?
  Added a test.

   o on building source tar on bubbles:

    cp -r doxygen /y/people/emsley/public_html/coot/doc
    snafing coot docs...
    ERROR: Unbound variable: drag-intermediate-atom-scm
    snafing coot docs done.
    texi2html coot-scheme.texi

* Fixed.

   o fill SCM ncs_chains_scm(int imol) and use it in
     ncs-other-chain-jump.  It can return #f, so in that case, revert
     back to using, as currently, (chain-ids imol).

* Done

   o If we have guile scripting in configure, then we should check for
     net-http and goosh have been installed.  If not, fail gracefully,
     not obscurely at run time!

* Done

   o If we have guile scripting in configure, then we should check for
     net-http and goosh have been installed.  If not, fail gracefully,
     not obscurely at run time!

* Done

   o fill SCM ncs_chains_scm(int imol) and use it in
     ncs-other-chain-jump.  It can return #f, so in that case, revert
     back to using, as currently, (chain-ids imol).

* Done

   o Add some SHELX reading to the test suite.  Insulin for starters.

* Done.

   o To make the test non-tedious, especially on slow computers, we
     need a set-atoms-attributes that takes a list of attribute sets.
     No need to re-calulate the bonding for each atom move.
     No need to redraw, except once at the end.

* Done.

   o Make a new dialog: clear up old/backup files on exit.
     86400 seconds per day

* Done.

   o Kleywegt plot should not draw ("wrapped") long arrows

* Done.

   o Torsion General

* Done.

   o Lars Prade crash.  Try doing actions in a directory that you can't
     write to.  Test Geometry validation.

* Seems OK to me.

   o work in the svn-revision.cc.  svn-revision.cc should be in
     Makefile.am, and be part of the tar file.  It should be generated
     after every time we do a svn update or commit.
 
* Done.

   o On pressing the filter button we get this ugliness:

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: coords_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: dataset_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: coords_fileselection1

** (lt-coot-real:8759): WARNING **: Widget not found: dataset_fileselection1

     on_filename_filter_toggle_button_toggled() looks up the
     fileselection by going through all names of file selections. This
     is ugly (gives terminal warnings).  Make the user data also encode 
     information about which fileselection this is (in 1000s, say).

* Fixed.

   o Dynamic distances on moving atom/fragments

* Fixed.

      Things to add or fix before 0.4


   o  move to interface-gui  handle_get_accession_code(GtkWidget *widget)

* Done

   o Refine and regularization parameters dialog: The Torsions
     Restraints check button is not set when it should be.

* Fixed.

   o Look at this: CSHL crash:

     on calculating a skeleton after deleting a map (and skeleton) and
     reading in a new map.
 
* Can't reproduce. Added some protection.  Maybe that'll fix it?

   o Python test should test for presence of Python.h in the
     appropriate include dir. (python exe environement may have been
     installed without python-dev)

* Done

   o  on simply closing the Go To Atom Widget

    (lt-coot-real:18301): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_unref: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

* Fixed

   o Pressing -Current-Dir- in Gtk2 version in Select Map results in:

      INFO:: Sorting files by date
      ** (lt-coot-real:6070): WARNING **: Widget not found: coords_fileselection1
      WARNING:: failed to find filesection in option_menu_refmac_ccp4i_project_signal_func

Fixed.

   o File -> Exit doesn't quit in gtk1 coot - backup-maybe problems I suspect.

* Fixed.  It was.  How did it ever work before?


   o int fileselection_type = 0; // FIXME
     c-interface-gui.cc:
void
option_menu_refmac_ccp4i_project_signal_func(GtkWidget *item, GtkPositionType pos) {

also:

void
handle_filename_filter_gtk1(GtkWidget *entry_widget) {
   
   int file_selection_type = 0; // FIXME
   Test by filtering scripts

* Done.


   o Every time I use "Edit backbone torsions", if I hit "cancel".
     The backbone thick white line is still there and it can be dragged
     to anywhere, which is kinda annoying.  But if I hit "OK", the white
     line is gone.

     Jianghai Zhu, Ph.D

* Can't reproduce.

    o remove this junk from output:

INFO:: setup minimol has spacegroup: P 21 21 21

* Fixed.

   o Check that map sampling rate can be varied for fcf files.
 
* Done.

   o check that sigmaA maps work now.

* Done.

   o Fix map transformation text pointed out by Stephen Graham

* Done.

   o Wendy Offen: disulphide drawn between CYS and close MET. Oops.
 
* Done.

   o Carsten's Map Masking crash

     Is it passing an out-of-date group?  No, looks to be handled
     correctly.  Wrote a test... didn't tickle the bug.  Tricky.

       #3  0x08295a48 in display_control_map_combo_box (
           display_control_window_glade=0x8cf4d60,

           gtk-manual.c:1160

     valgrind it?
* Will pass on this for now.  :-(.  More info needed.

   o Mark Saper: 

     I got another crash error with similar results.  This time
     clicking on a water (part of a 3 water split) and doing Real
     Space Refine Zone, it crashed everything.

click on 2 atoms (in the same molecule)

* Can't reproduce this.  But maybe it was a version before the alt conf of waters rigid body 
  refinement was touched.    

   o Steven Muchmore crash on mutating a residue

      A job for valgrind. 

         Hmmm - tried. Nothing obvious.  Mabye it was GTK2 problem?
         Test on penelope.

* Tested with Gtk2 and Valgrind.  Can't spot the problem.

      Copy molecule is valgrind-clean (both coords and map)
   o To make the test non-tedious, especially on slow computers, we
     need a set-atoms-attributes that takes a list of attribute sets.
     
       No need to re-calulate the bonding for each atom move.
 
       No need to redraw, except once at the end.

       Not for now.   Next release.

* Done. 

   o When undisplay a model, the ball and stick representation should be undisplayed too.

* Done.   


   o multireadpdb should not recentre [JED]

* Done.

    o Mark Saper: 

      I'm also seeing a crash when I try check waters with the latest
      coot from Fink, on Intel running 10.4.11.

   o Wendy Offen: 

     In Check/delete waters in the Validate menu, the Questionable
     Waters list should include occupancies as well as B factors.

* Done.

   o does the map sampling affect maps from fcf files?  Dale suggests not.

* It didn't.  It should now.

   o Get rid of this debugging:

    o Mark Sapper: 

    I'm running the most recent coot from Fink (0.4-pre-2 [with guile
    1.8.3 embedded] [with python 2.3.5 embedded]).

    While trying to adjust backbone torsions, I had a crash.  Perhaps
    it was because the following residue was beyond bonding distance
    to the carbonyl carbon?  Her's the output from the terminal:

click on an atom in the peptide to change

   o Turn on pythoning in build-it.  No special days.

* Done.

   o skeleton colour set correctly in the colour selector?

* Done.

   o kalypso gkt2: Fit Loop.  undo.  Fit loop. crash.

* Can't reproduce. Loop fitting is now backed up at start.

   o Fix mapman bones reader.  What does G(DVD)K say? he says move-to, draw-to.  But 
     can I make that work?  Yes I can. move it over.

* Done. Libcheck problem.  Needs new libcheck and/or dictionary.

o Submarining of green spot on Ramachandran Plot.  Also no green
  spot for GLY.

*Fixed.

   o Put limit of 180 clusters in fascinating-clusters-gui.

* Done

   o Dynamically add view to the Views Panel [FvD]

* Done.

   o Eddie's Snell anisotropic Bs form .res file.
     Write a test that checks that the shelx output is anisotropic.  

* Bug fixed.  Test another time (it's 10x harder than the fix)

   o Dynamically add view to the Views Panel [FvD]

* Done.

   o S. Sheriff:

     * I find that (set-colour-map-rotation-on-read-pdb-c-only-flag   1)
       in my .coot file does not work (at least in v0.3.3), i.e. until
       I click on the radio button in the bond colour pop-up menu, the
       atoms are not atomic coloring.

* Can't reproduce.  Bad ~/.coot, bugging out early?

   o Refine across an insertion code [Steven Sheriff] 27 -> 28 L in 1ruk.  
     Write a greg test for it.

   o S. Sheriff:

     * I find that (set-colour-map-rotation-on-read-pdb-c-only-flag   1)
       in my .coot file does not work (at least in v0.3.3), i.e. until
       I click on the radio button in the bond colour pop-up menu, the
       atoms are not atomic coloring.

* Can't reproduce.

   o Crash on OK on Map properties after changing map colour:
     [corrupted, useless stack]

*Fixed.

   o Try again to add chiral volumes to the geometry target function

* Done.

   o Remove debugging screen info in NCS ghosting (including on reading pdb)

* Done.

   o Load latest .scm file, key binding (96)

* Done.

   o Update environement distances after refinement

* Done.  Nice

   o Fix Rigid body fit zone dialog message.

* Done.

   o remove probability limit for RichRots
     look at LEUs.

* Done.

   o Extend the length of the entries in the SMILES interface

* Done

   o "Carriage Return" in the entry in Export map should do an "OK"

* Done.

   o Does the state file contain the hue shift for each of the
     coordinate molecules?  It should do.

Yes, it's fine.


   o Test Cootaneer by building from just a map - MOK's CSHL tutorial map.

* PE is not doing that. Job for BL.

   o Jan Dohnalek symmetry failing

* Fixed.

   o GMS Molprobity problem.

        Is a molprobity issue.  Get new version?

   o Pirkko Heikinheimo pdb entry 1o7d, space group P6122.  symmetry
     pick is failing.

* Done.

   o On reading a .res file, can you check for NCS with residue offset?
     Needs a test

* Done.

   o read in a .res file.  Does it see the default bond width?

* Done.

   o Problem with resizing window starting from a big one from the
     state file? JED

* Done.

   o Post-install slim the binaries

* Done.

   o Stub disappeared on simple mutate

* Done.

   o The reading of a cif dictionary should set the file name for the
     dialog like reading a pdb file does.

* Done

   o Eliminate Stub from the Mutate and Autofit residue chooser - it
     doesn't make sense there.

* Done.

   o Add darken-maps function

* Done

   o Add user setable env distance limit

   o glob overflow with latest-file.scm in top500H dir.

* Fixed.

   o Dictionaries should have their name chopped in the state file
     preamble - like pdbs and mtzs.

* Fixed.

   o Steven Graham:

      I seem to have found another small feature in 0.3.3.  When I
      read in an ensemble of 20 lowest-energy NMR structures, they
      display fine if displayed as C-alpha traces or as bonds coloured
      by atom, B-value sec.  structure or occupancy.  However, if I
      colour the bonds by chain or by molecule the connectivity goes
      all screwy (presumably because the different members of the
      ensemble all have the same chain ID).

* Done (except for bonds to hydrogens).

   o Correct CISPEP if needed cards on writing pdb.
     Hand off to Eugene for now.  Needs mmdb-1.0.10

* Done - And tested.

   o Do the strand restraints work well under refinement?

* Seems OK.

    o Check where else we do a SetSpaceGroup()?  Bug there too?

      Where else do I mess with the space group like I did at the end of 
      unshelxing?  Fix that too.

      Fixed coot-utils/coot-coord-utils.cc:      atoms_mol->SetSpaceGroup(sgc);
      Fixed coot-utils/coot-shelx-ins.cc:   shelx_mol->SetSpaceGroup(sgc);
      Fixed src/c-interface-mutate.cc:             mmdb_info.first->SetSpaceGroup(sgc);

      Not fixed: Frank's bug? (No, that was not Frank's bug - Franks
      bug was a mess in writing out the sequence alignment).

      src/c-interface-superpose.cc:    m2->SetSpaceGroup(sgc);

      The following need to be examined:
      src/c-interface-superpose.cc:    m2->SetSpaceGroup(sgc); fixed
      src/graphics-info.cc:      int istat_spgr = MMDBManager->SetSpaceGroup(copied_str); fixed
      src/graphics-info.cc:      std::cout << "status from SetSpaceGroup: " << istat_spgr << std::endl; yep
      src/molecule-class-info.cc:   mol_new->SetSpaceGroup(spacegroup_str); correct usage
      src/molecule-class-info.cc:      atom_sel.mol->SetSpaceGroup((char *)cell_spgr.second.c_str()); good
      src/molecule-class-info.cc:   atom_sel.mol->SetSpaceGroup((char *)spg.c_str()); // ok
      src/molecule-class-info-other.cc:           mol->SetSpaceGroup(sg); // fine

* Done

   o Fix non-orthorhombic aniso Us.

* Done.


   o res098 from Lionel Colliandre - alt conf occ resetting problem on
     regularize. 

* Fixed.  Needs a test. Done.

   o Alice Dawson SSM Problem, 1pyd.  Message sent to Eugene -
     He says no problem.  Therefore small example program is required
     to find the problem in SSM (or elsewhere of course).

* Done.

   o Frank's SSM crash.

* Done.

   o Build against new clipper (delete clipper from all autobuild trees).

	 York Bubbles: Don't care
	 York Auto:    Done
         Oxford cycle: Done
         Home:         Don't care
         Laptop:       Done

   o "Environment distances that label everything" - David Briggs

* Done.

   o Don't display symmetry with hydrogens if the main molecule
     doesn't have them [Stephen Graham]

* Done.       

   o Richardson rotamers

* Done.

   o history doesn't quote set-display-intro-string and
     handle-read-draw-molecule-with-recentre - it should.

* Done.

   o Activate test suite

* Done.

   o Fix Cootaneer crash

* Done.  It was a problem in trim_atom_label_table().

   o Multiple models overlapping does not delete the non-best fitting
     models. It should.

* It does - I don't know why I thought that it didn't.  Hmm...

   o specify default working molecule for water addition (esp. for
     key-bound water addition) [JED]

* Done.  You need to set it using "Place Atom at Pointer" molecule
  chooser (then Cancel that dialog).

   o are the findwaters and findligands being installed correctly
     (with wrappers?).  Get a pre-release tar ball and look at that.

* Seems fine.  Ask eleanor to run it on the command line

   o Make the Omega Angle Plot update properly in
     update_geometry_graphs()

* Done.

   o C key press in the graphics runs the graphics-general-key-press-hook.  
     It should not.

* Fixed.

   o When refining, add a status bar message that describes the Ctrl
     button usage.

* Done. 

   o Is there a memory problem in unshelx?  Valgrind it, I suppose.

* Yes, there was.  Messing with copying the Space group name.  No need
  SetSpaceGroup() does a string copy.

   o try read phs, read a pdb to get cell, pdb file does not have cell
     -> crash. 	deliang chen <deliangc@uci.edu>

       Date: 	Fri, 27 Jul 2007 00:26:26 +0200  (Thu, 23:26 BST)

* Seems OK under valgrind - a WinCoot bug?

   o Get B factors from shelx Us (for B factor variance plot)

* Done.

   o Crash report by "Gajiwala, Ketan": CR in graphics after Acc/Rej
     was deleted.

* Fixed (I guess).

   o re-work the cootaneering gui, use a sub-menu.

* Done.

   o Ignore hydrogens in B-factor variance plot

* Done     

   o auto-read-shelx-project: check if fcf is more recent than fcf.cif
     before auto-loading fcf.cif

* Done.

   o Add a PIR sequence reader for cootaneering

* Done.

   o Add select by sphere to test suite

* Done.

   o Add planar peptide restraints as default

* Done.

   o Add Chiral centre inversion and cis peptide generation check 
     after refinement or regularization.

     - move bad_chiral_volumes() to coot-coord-extras and use it to
     check chiral volumes after refinement (i.e. we should get a
     warning info_dialog on top of (displayed after) the Accept/Reject
     dialog. 

* Actually, simple-restraint.cc was the right place because coot-utils
  are low level and don't use simple-restraint.hh

     Also test a mmdb for a cis peptide.  Add that function to
     coot-coord-utils.hh 
	
     std::vector<std::pair<coot::residue_spec_t, coot::residue_spec_t> > 
	test_for_cis_peptides(CMMDBManager *fragment_mol);

* Done - I'm not sure I like the way the dialogs work... but perhaps
  too much warning is better than not enough?

   o Gtk Timeout for reading socket strings

* Done in 0.3.2 in fact.

   o Select residues (for new molecule) by sphere

* Done

   o Multiple model ligand overlaying

* Done.

   o Cootaneer

* Done.

   o fix db-main so that it doesn't spew error messages

* Done.  Trivial

   o unshelxing is interfering with go to atom from lst file reader.
     How about this cunning plan:  
     (shelx-lst-conversion-func imol) returns a function that takes
     the lst residue number as an arg and returns a (list chain-id
     resno).  The body of the returned func will depend on the output
     of unshelx().

    CMMDBManager *unshelx(CMMDBManager *mol);
    need to also return mapping info
    vector of 
    [input_threash -> (chain-id resno-offset)]
    i.e. if residue_num >= input_threash we have a given chain-id and
    resno offset.
    run over all sets of [input_threash -> (chain-id resno-offset)] to get the 
    correct offset

* Done.

   Things to fix before 0.3.2

   o Change the Release notes, 
     the ChangeLog, 
     configure.in (obviously)
     old coot timer


   o Ramachandran Plot and Kleywegt Plot interact badly causing crash.

* Fixed.  Simply we can't have both.

   o Fix the carriage return on Check Delete waters result.  It should
     do a next button, not a click on the OK button.

* Easy fix - done in glade.

   o set-map-display, set-mol-displayed, set-mol-active.  Do they
     properly toggle the buttons in the Display Manager?  They should.

* They didn't.  They do now.  It worked first time :)

   o Fix the File-name filter: in script file reading

* Done.

   o Sort out the Cholesky decomposition.  Question to self: what are
     the matrices that are being decomposed, exactly?
     
     Good question.  That broke the back of the problem actually.  I
     compared thox.pdb Us with thos.res Us and found they were
     different (a transposition).  Now U matrix principal minors are
     checked before cholesky decomposition is performed.

 * Done!

   o mainchain zone, reverse dir, mainchain zone, screwed mainchain

* Done.

   o residue range was inserted into the wrong place in the pdb file

* Done.

   o copy fragment, residue range miss - feedback required.

* Done.

   o optionally animate fit-waters

* Done.

   o Mask map should have an inversion check button.

* Done.

   o Kleywegt plots don't update properly when not specifying chains.

* Done.

   o Saving in another directory - remember the save dir for next
     molecule to be saved.

* Done.

   o copy fragment, residue range miss - feedback required.

* Done.     

   o Disappearing NCS ghosts on changing NCS master 

     Also:

	Coot behaves differently depending on which chain I've chosen
	as the "master". When A is master, I can click the display box
	on/off and it simply displays (or hides) the ghost chains with
	no fuss. However, if I chosen a different chain as master,
	then each time I turn the ghosts on it recalculates the entire
	alignment.

* Done.

   o Thick bonds do not get set/groked in state file - they should be.

* Done.

   o transform-map

* Done.

   o Multiple coordinate molecules, inconsistent when starting up go
     to atom window.  Residue tree not same molecule as molecule
     chooser.  It only fails on startup.

* Fixed.

   o Do residue refinement after nucleotide add terminal residue (or
     can it be done trivially using the same mechanism as
     add-terminal-resdue-do-post-refine?

* Man, that was hard work.  Needed nucleotide to nucleotide function

   o Bad logic in setting display/active for molecules (Bob Nolte bug)

        If I turn on the display manager in my .coot file, and then
        load a coot state file which toggles off some of the loaded
        structures, the display manager gets confused and shows the
        wrong state.

* Fixed.

   o fix this:

	Kevin was doing some building and Coot lost the spacegroup.
	Adding UNK terminal residues
	Reversing the chain direction (probably this one?)
	db-main for new mainchain

* Done. Trival error in transfering spacegroup string.  Fixed malloc
  error in show-spacegroup while debugging this, which was much more
  important.

   o Stereo buttons need to be fixed

       Need to check that wall and cross eyes work

* Done.

   o Fix text widget in Sequence reading code (e.g. Fit Loop)

* Done.

   o Residue Info edits not being applied

* Done.

   o Delete a View number

* Done.

   o Save views to view file.

* Done.

   o Ramachandran plot window should remember where it was put

* Done.

   o Colour by B-factor

* Done

   o Colour by occupancy

* Done

   o Fix text widget in About 

* Done.

   o Alt confs fly apart in regularization of ligands.

* Done.

   o CNS map reading

* Done.

   o CNS data reading

* Kevin says leave it.  Fine.

   o Juergen's bad map

* Hand off to Kevin, bad map.

   o Put a file selector on the shelxl refine interface.

* Done.

   o Spin View 

* Done.

   How should "Check for updates" work.

   In scheme, of course

   It should know the current coot-version

   It needs to get the latest stable relesed version and 
   the release notes for that.

   So the release notes should be on the web site.  I think that they
   are...

   So it needs to get the current stable release version (a string)
   from the web site.  How shall that be done?

      get the stable release binary list web page.  Search as we do
      for the latest coot version as we do in the build-it file (that
      involves awk).

   Then, if there is a new release, get the release notes file and put
   the contents into a scrolled text window.

Christopher Rife:

   I've noticed that when using "NCS Control" in Coot, it behaves
   differently depending on which chain I've chosen as the
   "master". When A is master, I can click the display box on/off and
   it simply displays (or hides) the ghost chains with no
   fuss. However, if I chosen a different chain as master, then each
   time I turn the ghosts on it recalculates the entire
   alignment. This is rather cumbersome with large structures...

  variable and moved upstairs to the invoking function.

  Randy Read:

  It's currently tedious to make a native patterson.  So add an option
  to do it for me.  You'll have to change the space group to have the
  symmetry of the Patterson and make up a column of zeros for the phase.

  (patterson mtz-filename f-col origin-remove-flag) returns an int

* Problem gone away with cpatterson.

   Problem with doing Randy's sidebyside screen update:

   to solve his problem we want to 
	draw(glarea1)
	draw(glarea2)
	swap_buffers(glarea1)
	swap_buffers(glarea2)

   so we have to move swap_buffers *out* of the draw() function. 

   OK, I did that.

   The problem now is with the expose_event callback.

   the expose event callback is what is used by draw()

   urgh.

* Anyway, fixed now.

   Do this at some stage (but not before 0.3.2)

   o Valgrind long/multiple fit-proteins

   o better documentation for skip-to-next-ncs-chain

  Stephen Graham:

     I had just another minor quibble with coot... If one reads in a
     molecule with hydrogens in the PDB file, and one turns the
     display of hydrogens off using 'Edit > Bond Parameters', any
     symmetry-related molecules that are drawn still have protons
     displayed.

     Is there an easy way to not display protons for symmetry
     molecules?

  This is a bug. 

  Priority: High.

*Fixed.

---- 
Wed Jul  4 12:58:51 BST 2007

   o copy over sgi coot 0.3.3

* Done.

   Related to above:

	Add a greg test:

	Add atom (at pointer, I suppose), add atom, add atom.

	Label atoms.

	delete atom 

	delete atom

	delete atom

* Done.

	I was testing sphere atoms.  I had pointer distances up.  I
	going to delete atoms to count them.  Mabye I labelled lots of
	atoms.  I guess I had a go to atom up (maybe not).

	I fired up Delete, changed to delete water, keep active.

	I clicked on an atom

	Boom, crash.

OK, here's how to reproduce:

	start from 0crash.scm
        add pointer distances
	Fire up Go to atom
	Close with top right WM button
	Delete, Delete Atom, Active
	Click an atom
	Crash.


It said this in the console:

  I find the option to use the directories and projects i have defined
  for ccp4i in the coot file-selection menus rather VERY useful. now
  it turns out i do have quite a few projects defined in ccp4, and the
  list runs off the bottom of my screen in coot (while ccp4 breaks it
  over and starts a second column and a third ...). any chance ... ???

  and while you are at it ... would you still have an option to also
  use ccp4 aliases in coot on your 'to think about' list ? this would
  be quite a luxury ... you once said this might be possible ...

* Done.

  ehem ... another idea ... would anybody else be interested in having
  a button to undisplay ALL maps at once in the display menu pop-up
  ???

* A bit of scripting can do this (done).

   How about some flexibility in file name output?

     How difficult is it to create (or, maybe, How would one go about
     creating a) naming system for output PDB files that is consonant
     with my usage?  Currently COOT gives a default of
     input_file_name-coot-0.pdb.  I typically name my files
     model_0i.pdb for the file out of refinement (before ligand, hence
     the zero -- yes I do it too ;-) ) and my first output file as
     model_0o1.pdb.  If I do some "editing" outside of COOT, I might
     then create model_0i2.pdb and if I make some changes inside COOT,
     the output file would be model_0o2.pdb, etc.  After the next
     cycle of refinement, I would come in with model_1i.pdb, etc.

	Cis-peptides, planar peptide restraints

	Good density fit graph (and how to scale it)

	Nomenclature errors in rotamers - and how to fix them
	   Missing atoms

	How to use with Molprobity (web output and local exes)

	B-factor variance.  What's good and bad.

-----
Tue Aug 21 14:44:14 BST 2007

	Note to self:

	B factor average, variance vs resolution for each residue type.

	Probably best to have a shell script to provide the pdb files
	
	c++ program reads pdbs and does b-factor analysis, 

            on completion appends to files "ARG.tab" "ASP.tab" etc
            with average and variance for each residue of that type in
            that pdb file.  Also the resolution.

	    only do 1 chain of each pdb file.

            use Coot libs - make it a Coot program.

   How do I change my residue to have insertion code and the following
   residues to have -1 offset and it all to be joined up?

   e.g.:
   (change-residue-number 0 "C" 86 "" 85 "A")
   Which is fine, execpt I can't then move C/85A to the A chain.

    Plans for multi-stick representations

    class line_representation {
      representation_type { atom_bond, CA, CA+ligand etc }
      bonds_container
      displayed_flag
      bond_thickness
      colour_rotation

        resno_2;
	insode_1;
	insode_2;
      }
    };
      
    We shall use a std::vector<line_representation> line_rep_vec;  
    New items are pushed back.  You can't delete an item from this
    vector, mearly not display it (the handles are passed back - and
    we don't want them to go out of date).

    Particular alt confs cannot be selected for.

    Questions:  How shall we create new represenations for this molecule?

    // return 
    int add_representation imol represenation-spec

    // used by GUI
    undisplay_represenation imol respresentation-number

    undisplay_represenation imol residue_spec
    which needs to be unambiguated. Test in this order:

     o Was there a line_representation that has that residue_spec?
     o Was there a residue_range line_representation that encompassed that residue_spec?
     o Was that residue in a chain that has a line_representation?

   On calculating blobs from a difference map:

10.40 (10.40 sigma) at xyz = (  22.35, 3.493, 70.95)   #  1.06 A separated from one above;
10.31 (10.31 sigma) at xyz = (  22.6, 4.587, 70.69)  # # 0.07 A separated from two above; 1.15 A separated from one above

"My view is that I don't want to see all 3 of these in the list, one would do. "

    One can see something similar if you peak search the difference
    map, I think.  Tweak the difference map algorithm to filter out
    sub-sites that are close to already found sites.

    Now I am compiling gtk2+ becuase the system gtk2+ on cycle (FC4)
    is too old to complile Coot.

    I am doing it on cycle in ~/compile
    I created setup pango-glib-gtk2 with PKG_CONFIG settings.
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4

    glib 2.12.13 straightforward
    pango 1.16.4 straightforward
    fine.  
    Oh for gtk2 though, cairo is not an option.  It is a must.  Baah.
    That was not clear in www.gtk.org.

    So get cairo 1.4.14 from http://cairographics.org/releases/

    which means get glitz from http://cairographics.org/snapshots/
    (gotta have glitz, right?)

    glitz-0.5.6 
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4 --enable-glitz
    This displays a warning about using glitz, but configures OK.
    Compiles OK.

    back to pango:
    now with cairo in place, pango's configure finds cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to Gtk2+:
    glib version test failed, so need to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH too (to the setup file)
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Fine.  But Coot configure fails on gtlglExt

    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtkglext/gtkglext-1.2.0.tar.gz?modtime=1139081517&big_mirror=1
    back to GtkGLExt:
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Coot now compiles OK.  And runs! Great.
    But - it doesn't load svgs.

    OK, back-up. 

    config.log for cairo tells us we need a newer librsvg:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/librsvg-2.20.0.tar.gz (2 days old at 
    time of writting)

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Warns us that we are not compiling with libcroco.
    Oh well.

    OK, now librsvg is in place configure finds it.
    Rebuilding cairo
    Install.

    Fine.  Now coot loads its svgs.  Yay!

    PyGtk needs pycairo


    Correct build order:
    glitz
    glib
    librsvg
    cairo
    pango
    gtk+-2
    glkglext

Hmm...


checking for LIBRSVG... configure: error: Package requirements (        gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 1.3.7         glib-2.0 >= 2.12.0      libxml-2.

Requested 'pangoft2 >= 1.2.0' but version of Pango FT2 is 1.1.1

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/cairo.html

  Note that the GTK, Poppler and librsvg packages are circular in that
  using them for test suite coverage requires installing cairo first,
  then installing the desired package(s), then installing cairo again.

    make new molecules.  Or cut/paste.

    Idea needs more details.

 Sergs' presentation:
 Autosolve ligand detection Mooji (?) 2006?


 Use cluster volume vs contour threshhold plot (of the difference map)
 to detect the cluster (volume decreases with contour level less for
 real ligand than noise.

 and use the blob that is closest to the protein (Frank is sceptical
 about that).
 
 there is some sort of shape function too (I missed how).  ah, 7
 statistics, sufrace to volume ratio, eigen values etc.

    Import an ATP.

    Regularize it.

    furanose ring is flattened... why?

    Bug, I'd say

    On testing, maybe not.  Is the restraints.
    Need to get other restraints for ATP.

  Get a list of ATPs from pdb to fit *this* particular ATP

  (will do conformation search for us).

  Report the structure that matched.

  In fact, download the matchng structure and overlay it on the
  ligand.

  why not use graphics_info_t::molecules[imol].atom_to_atom_index()?
