To compile guile etc for gtk2:


prfx=$HOME/guile-1.8.1
wget libtool-1.5.22.tar.gz
cd libtoo-1.5.22
./configure --prefix=$prfx
make 
make install

wget guile-1.8.1.tar.gz
cd guile-1.8.1
./configure --prefix=$prfx CFLAGS=-I$prfx/include LDFLAGS=-L$prfx/lib
# on cycle at least, we need to stop the optimization:
./configure --prefix=$prfx "CFLAGS=-I$prfx/include -g" LDFLAGS=-L$prfx/lib
make 
make install

wget guile-gtk-2.0.tar.gz
cd guile-gtk-2.0
./configure --prefix=$prfx --without-gtkgl

# gtkglext:
wget "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtkglext/gtkglext-1.2.0.tar.gz?modtime=1139081517 & big_mirror=1"


# make sure when you compile guile-gtk-2.0, you pick up the right
# guile in your path (i.e. 1.8.x) otherwise libguile will be stuck in
# the guilegtk.la file and it wil cause a mess.

   Those who compile with gtk2 need to regenerate the interface files
   coot_wrap_guile.cc and coot_wrap_guile_pre.cc by runing swig
   (delete them and make)

   symmetry-related hydrogens don't appear (they flash off)

   intelligent next atom should consider insertion codes.

   How should "Check for updates" work.

   In scheme, of course

   It should know the current coot-version

   It needs to get the latest stable relesed version and 
   the release notes for that.

   So the release notes should be on the web site.  I think that they
   are...

   So it needs to get the current stable release version (a string)
   from the web site.  How shall that be done?

      get the stable release binary list web page.  Search as we do
      for the latest coot version as we do in the build-it file (that
      involves awk).

   Then, if there is a new release, get the release notes file and put
   the contents into a scrolled text window.
