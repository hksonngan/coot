3lhj A 361  LHJ
3hvh A 1    542 
2aei ??? 
1g3b ??? horrific ligand layout-based star wars problems.
2rh1 A 408  CAU (important to get this better looking). 
            What about the ASN A312 H-bond donor to the H on the ligand?
            Mistake, I feel - needs investigating.

test_refmac1.pdb from David Banner. LIG, get it from the PDB.  Donor
  to ligand Cl? No. H-bond to Gly216? perhaps not. So says JED.

2w3l Can't sprout hydrogens.  Also valence problem on residue->2d

1j4r overlapping ligand problems (graphics window view is nice though)

1xxb: fit the ligand using normal tools (with Flexible).  Fails

Still crashing.

Differently though.

Add a ring, then a wedge bond off the ring. Try to cycle the
wedgedness a bit [1] and add 3 more bonds to this one -> crash.


[1] well, it's a bit broken: after a few cycles it's won't do all 4

    if 2 neighbours are coming in horizontally (axis orientation < 40
