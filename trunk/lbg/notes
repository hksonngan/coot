3hvh A 1    542 
2aei ??? 
1g3b ??? horrific ligand layout-based star wars problems.
2rh1 A 408  CAU (important to get this better looking). 
            What about the ASN A312 H-bond donor to the H on the ligand?
            Mistake, I feel - needs investigating.

draw 2 fused benzenes (napthalene?)
Apply 
then View in LIDIA
then delete 2nd ring
move the molecule a bit
then add new 5-member ring.  (5 member ring is added inside the 6 member ring)

(because ring centre info is wrong or missing?)

   mol's add_bond() method should not add a bond between given atoms
   if a bond between them already exists. (fix problem of "back-bond"
   in rotate_latest_bond()).  Hmm... is that properly handled in
   rotate_latest_bond()?

    in ZZG (A 1500) of 2wot, the HOH A2051 should be H-bonded to N24
    of the ligand (reject on angles somehow?).  This might be
    impossible without generating hydrogen positions.

    JED: break molecule in to bits, add bonds, change bonds to double
    and back with lots of undos.  delete atoms -> crash eventually.

   * Can't reproduce crash, but there are bonding/veiwable deleted
     atoms errors and reappearing bonds.

----

    look at 3h7w.  Problems.

* Angle of bonds to ligand.  Hard to solve.  What are the angles in a
  H-bond?

----

    look at 3lhj.  Problems

* Looks good now.

----

    look at 3hec.  Problems.

* OK now

    look at 1g3b. Problems

   JED: It won't let me do a wedge bond in a ring (say the spiro
   position in MI6)


Still crashing.

Differently though.

Add a ring, then a wedge bond off the ring. Try to cycle the
wedgedness a bit [1] and add 3 more bonds to this one -> crash.


[1] well, it's a bit broken: after a few cycles it's won't do all 4
variants, just 2 of them

----
 
    in triple bond add mode, the bond should be added as a triple bond
    (not double).

    Also, should be linear.

----

   Fix the search (fraction of atoms in search fragment)

----

   need to have user control over bond direction (JME does it when the
   mouse moves away from the clicked-on atom).


---

   When dragging a bond, the end of the bond should snap to an atom
   when we mouse over it.

---

   get_scale_correction() needs to be looked, c.f. 
   i.e. input_coords_to_canvas_coords() and write_mdl_molfile() 


----

   Import 515, X offset is wrong.

---- 


    \  /   should be  \ /  and similar for up NH bonds
     NH                N
                       H

    if 2 neighbours are coming in horizontally (axis orientation < 40
    say) , that is.

    and OH should be HO if the bond comes in from the right.

----

   INFO:: 

     106 4-(5-BROMO-2-OXO-2H-INDOL-3-YLAZO)-BENZENESULFONAMIDE is
     an excellent example of the difference between PRODRG and SBase.

     sp3 vs sp2 nitrogen.  The hydrogen on N1, whats going on there?  A
     double-bond was invented by PRODRG.  The nitrogen on the sulfur.

   delete mode needs to work

* Done.

--------

    important:

    Add ring
    Add bond
    Add rind (on end of bond)

    gives a bond with an atom bonded to itself (the atom on the stalk)

* Fixed


----

    It would be nice to have the aromatic ring double bonds draw with
    a shorter inner bond rather than a double bond either side of the
    mid-line.

* Done.  It *is* nice.

---
 
   aromatic hexagon needs to work

* Done.

----

   The orientation of the rings needs to be altered so that
   six-membered rings can be added horizontally.

* Done. Better now.

----

   in placement of single bonds, is the "closed" status of deleted
   atom positions taken into account?  (I think not).

* Done.

----

    Add a ring.
 
    Change a C to a N.

    Add a bond to the N (NH)

    --> the NH should change to a N but it does not.

* Done.

   stamp a ring

   cut the bond, cut the CH4

   add a bond in the same place {the bond is short }

   stamp a ring.  
   Change a C to an N 
   Add a bond to the N
   delete the atom at the end
   
   -> N should change back to NH, does not.

    try to flatten and export to lbg something with a Hg in it.
    PRODRG has exit status 1, we should check for this and give a
    dialog.

   Fix the bond centre. e.g. import 3IB indolebutyric acid

* Done.

----

   CRZ gives a incorrect centre and no hydrogens.

* That problem is fixed.

   Read in 003, flatten it.  A bond to an O is a ring double bond :-(

* Done, I hope.



----

   File -> Save as broken, needs work.

   Fix the option menu

---

    JED:
 
    Place an O, get an OH, place another.
    undo
    the first O is not OH as it should be.

* Done

   Make a 6 membered ring - saturated.

   replace a C with an N.

   add an bond. Add another bond, N should go to N+, but does not until the 
   canvas drag.

   Sat Jun  5 00:17:32 CEST 2010
   actually, it crashes now :)

* Fixed. squeeze_in_a_4th_bond() needs to update the atom ids after
  bond addition.

   Prodrg makes cif files that are non-polymers.  such things fail to
   make links from find_link_rigorous().  Hence no covalent links from
   PRODRG-generated dictionary cifs.  

   OK, so when we are displaying a regular residue (standard residues
   perhaps?), one that we have in the dictionary..., then don't read in
   the prodrg dictionary - read in the refmac one (if necessary).

   HOHs in residue-info.txt should have the length of the qualifying
