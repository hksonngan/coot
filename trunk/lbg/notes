    Write a mol file.  Read it in.  It has become expanded.

------
  
    JED: break molecule in to bits, add bonds, change bonds to double
    and back with lots of undos.  delete atoms -> crash eventually.

   * Can't reproduce crash, but there are bonding/veiwable deleted
     atoms errors and reappearing bonds.

----
 
    in triple bond add mode, the bond should be added as a triple bond
    (not double).

    Also, should be linear.

----

   Fix the search (fraction of atoms in search fragment)

----

   need to have use control over bond direction (JME does it when the
   mouse moves away from the clicked-on atom).


---

   When dragging a bond, the end of the bond should snap to an atom
   when we mouse over it.


----

   Import 515, X offset is wrong.

---- 


    \  /   should be  \ /  and similar for up NH bonds
     NH                N
                       H

    if 2 neighbours are coming in horizontally (axis orientation < 40
    say) , that is.

    and OH should be HO if the bond comes in from the right.

----

   INFO:: 

     106 4-(5-BROMO-2-OXO-2H-INDOL-3-YLAZO)-BENZENESULFONAMIDE is
     an excellent example of the difference between PRODRG and SBase.

     sp3 vs sp2 nitrogen.  The hydrogen on N1, whats going on there?  A
     double-bond was invented by PRODRG.  The nitrogen on the sulfur.

=================================================================================



   delete mode needs to work

* Done.

--------

    important:

    Add ring
    Add bond
    Add rind (on end of bond)

    gives a bond with an atom bonded to itself (the atom on the stalk)

* Fixed


----

    It would be nice to have the aromatic ring double bonds draw with
    a shorter inner bond rather than a double bond either side of the
    mid-line.

* Done.  It *is* nice.

---
 
   aromatic hexagon needs to work

* Done.

----

   The orientation of the rings needs to be altered so that
   six-membered rings can be added horizontally.

* Done. Better now.

----

   in placement of single bonds, is the "closed" status of deleted
   atom positions taken into account?  (I think not).

* Done.

----

    Add a ring.
 
    Change a C to a N.

    Add a bond to the N (NH)

    --> the NH should change to a N but it does not.

* Done.

printing:

cairo_t*        goo_canvas_create_cairo_context (GooCanvas *canvas);

void            goo_canvas_render           (GooCanvas             *canvas,
                                             cairo_t               *cr,
                                             const GooCanvasBounds *bounds,
                                             gdouble                scale);
* Done.  From example.

---

    cyclo-propane - bond - cyclo-propane

    v. short bond.  

    cf 8-ring - bond 8-ring

* Done.

----

     Adding a N at a junction between a stereo bond and a ring should
     mean that the N is N not NH.

* Done.


--------
 
   undo mode needs to work

* Done.

----

   stamp a ring
  
   add a bond 

   cut the bond, cut the CH4

   add a bond in the same place {the bond is short }

   try change the atom at the end of the bond to N 

   -> fail

* Done.

----


     loading from an MDL file would be cool.

* it *is* nice.

----
  
    connect up sbase.

* Done.  Needs work.

----

   stamp a ring.  
   Change a C to an N 
   Add a bond to the N
   delete the atom at the end
   
   -> N should change back to NH, does not.

* Done.


----

    try to flatten and export to lbg something with a Hg in it.
    PRODRG has exit status 1, we should check for this and give a
    dialog.

* Fixed.

----
 
   Fix the bond centre. e.g. import 3IB indolebutyric acid

* Done.

----

   CRZ gives a incorrect centre and no hydrogens.

* That problem is fixed.

-----


   Read in 003, flatten it.  A bond to an O is a ring double bond :-(

* Done, I hope.



----

   File -> Save as broken, needs work.


----

   Fix the option menu

---

    JED:
 
    Place an O, get an OH, place another.
    undo
    the first O is not OH as it should be.

* Done


----


   pan canvas (or move molecule) needs to work
   c.f. goo_canvas_scroll_to()
   consider adding a callback to the scroll-event event on the root canvas

* Done
