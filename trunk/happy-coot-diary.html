    <h1>The Happy Coot Developer Diary</h1>

<p> Mon 04 Jun 16:44:22 2007 BST</p>

<p>More tinkering with views, state file additions, Raster3D output.
Ramachandrans now tell us about number of residues in favoured regions
and outliers.
</p>

<p>LSQ fitting now returns an SCM representation of the orientation
matrix.  So then it was straightforward to add a function that takes a
residue range selection, generates the matrix from that and applies it
to a map.  Isn't that cool? - no need to type in a wretched matrix.
</p>

<p>A hundred or so more functions add themselves to the session
history.  That was tedious code, I'll tell you... </p>

    <p>I have a new screen! A Viewsonic VG2230WM. It's big (22inch)
    1650x1050 and super-crisp (DVI).  I like it a lot.</p>

    <p>Wrote a seminar for Bernhard for Prague. </p>

    <p> Plowed through all the bugs in the list for 0.3.2.  Today,
    more relaxed, playing with Views and adding user configurable
    variables to the Ramachandran plot. </p>

<hr>
    <p>Wed May 16 00:59:52 BST 2007 </p>

    <p> Busy triaging bugs and fixing code this week.  Head down for a
    new release.  Then I can start playing with Cootaneer and links
    and fascinating-clusters.  4 bugs (of 16) left...</p>

    <p> Having said that, I need to prepare a tutorial for Martin's
    Wellcome Crystallography Course thingy this afternoon. </p> 

    <p> My screen is dead.  Must get a new one. </p>

<hr>
   <p>Friday May 11 2007 </p>

    <p>Pharma day. Quite good.  One crash and one problem of the
    return value of (inexact->exact (/ 1 2)) changing in guile
    1.8.</p>

<hr>
   <p>Thurs May 10 2007 </p>

    <p>Poker night.  I was gambling on the river far too much in the
    early stages. I stopped doing that and did better later on.</p>

<hr>
   <p>Tues May 8 2007 </p>

    <p>Yes, the new molecule code from a scheme description is a good
    thing.  I have added some excercising code to jiggle the atoms
    about and it mananged to update at about 150 residues/second.  That
    was for a 2 residue segment - I didn't try a whole protein.</p>

<hr>
   <p>Fri May  4 10:48:08 BST 2007 </p>

    <p>The Views system is pretty cute now, I think. I need to add the
    ability to add views from the scripting layer.</p>

    <p> Thinking about it last night, it seems to me that we also need
    a function that generates a <i>new</i> molecule from a scheme
    description.</p>

<hr>
   <p>Thu May  3 18:24:06 BST 2007 </p>

   <P>
   I've been working for days now trying to get a multi-threaded
   version to work.  It seems to work for me, but TT downloaded a
   binary and said that it gave him some Xlib async error.  Baah.
   Don't know what to do now.
   </P>

   <P>
     So, I turned my attention to adding terminal residues for nucleic
     acid polymers.  It seems to work, although I am not sure it has the
     best orientation matrix.
   </P>

   <P>
   The other thing was generating a molecule in a scheme representation (e.g. 
   <a href="http://coot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/example-scm-mol-representation.scm">here</a>).  So any program can throw a molecule at coot and it will be displayed and updated.  This has lots of potential, I think.
</P>

    <p>imlib linking tribulations... argh! </p>
<hr>
    <p> Wed Apr 25 11:39:33 BST 2007 </p>

    <p> Wow! Multi-threaded programming is complicated... </p>

<hr>
    <p> Tue Apr 24 23:45:40 BST 2007</p>

    <p> I left my laptop power supply in the lecture theatre at the
    BCA.  Silly me. </p>

    <p> I should be doing work on the NCS copy chain crash, but I've
    been diverted on to multi-threaded work so that interaction with
    Phenix will work.  However, it's a complex mess that has put Coot
    in an unstable situation where strange things happen.  I don't
    like it.</p>
    
    <p> Maybe I'll go back to idle function usage... </p>

    <p> More fixes for Gtk2 mode.  Gtk2 is pretty smooth now and it's
    the build I use for development on the Ubuntu machine. The build
    script is going to take a lot of reworking for Gtk2... I'm not
    looking forward to that...</p>

    <p> I tried turning on DRI again, now that this is the official
    Feisty release.  Starting coot crashed the machine hard in 3
    seconds.  Ho hum... </p>

    <p>The delay on starting applications on the laptop is solved.
    Woop.  I straced the applications (gnome-terminal) and saw that it
    was hanging on something to do with GnomeSM.  So I googled for
    "slow ubuntu gnome" and it was the first hit (the solution is to
    put the hostname on the 127.0.0.1 line next to localhost).
    </p>

    <p> I'm getting used to the keyboard, so the only really annoying
    thing left is the wretched trackpad tapping mode.</p>
    
    <p> I love the dual processors though.. yum yum! </p>

    <p>(Peter Zwart says that he is a Phenix developer and a Coot
    user... (ok, fair enough...)) </p>

    <P>
      Back from the BCA.  Lots of edits to be committed.  Now we have
      views (I need to work on the interpolation of the quaternions).
      The other thing is identification of blob under cursor and
      moving it to the middle of the screen.  Things I've been
      thinking about for a long time (the "views" I saw in PyMol while
      I was in Gif sur Yvette 18 months ago) but only took an hour or
      so to implement.  Baah.  Too bogged down in fixing bugs.
    </P>

<hr>
    <p> Mon Apr 16 2007 </p>

    <p> Preparing for talk at the BCA... puting new figures
    together. </p>

    <p> Inkscape now has blurring.  Cool..! (I used them in my blurred
    shadows in a few of the BCA slides).  I do need to know more about
    graphic design to make the most of them though, I think... </p>

<hr>
    <p> Thursday 12 April </p>

    <p> At Garib's Refinement Workshop - difficult to find time to do
    emails.</p>

    <p> I didn't bring my camera with me... That was a mistake. </p>

<hr>
    <p> Mon Apr  9 01:51:44 BST 2007 </p>

    <p>I did the 0.3 Release on Saturday, but soon found out there was
    an error when I tried to use the build on a Mac.
    <p>So, I fixed that problem and released 0.3.1 later on that day.

    <p>No problems reported yet, but I believe that there may be a
    problem lurking in the Z-weighted rigid body refinement. I fixed
    that today.

    <p>Been doing some more work for the BCA talk too.  The strand
    fitting is <a href="diary/coot-3-strands.png">pretty good</a> now.
    But there is at least <a
    href="diary/coot-bad-strand-1.5sigma.png">one problem</a> left.
    The tube orientation code <a
    href="diary/coot-bad-strand-high-sigma.png">loves sulfurs</a>.

    <p>Yesterday I fixed up the GTk2 code path for the Filter and Sort
    buttons.  Quite invovled because it involves the complex
    GtkTreeView.


<hr>
<p> Thu Apr  5 13:01:03 BST 2007</p>

    <p>So, I've been trying to find a solution to the ridiculously
    sensitive touchpad issue, and <a
    href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=975421">here</a> I
    found the following:

<p>
   <cite>I must say that i was bedazzled at how easily it was to set
   up a wireless internet connection in Ubuntu, but I
   seriously/literally cannot work with ubuntu if every slightest
   touch i do on my touchpad causes me to select what is underneath
   (with annoying and unpredictable consequences). I am seriously
   going to have to find another distro, JUST BECAUSE OF THIS! 
   Unbelievable. Why can't anybody just fix the stupid thing instead
   of making people wait for a new version of Ubuntu which from what i
   see still isn't fixed? Who has a solution?!
   </cite>

   <p> and that well expresses how I feel.  
   <p> The message was sent over a year ago.  Baah.

    <p>It seems to me that the Synaptic configuration tools won't work
    because the X server unloads the module:

<pre>
(II) Synaptics touchpad driver version 0.14.6 (1406)
Synaptics Touchpad no synaptics event device found (checked 19 nodes)
(**) Option "Device" "/dev/psaux"
(**) Option "SHMConfig" "true"
(**) Option "HorizScrollDelta" "0"
Query no Synaptics: 6003C8
(EE) Synaptics Touchpad no synaptics touchpad detected and no repeater device
(EE) Synaptics Touchpad Unable to query/initialize Synaptics hardware.
(EE) PreInit failed for input device "Synaptics Touchpad"
(II) UnloadModule: "synaptics"
</pre>

<p>Go away hateful hateful touchpad!  I feel at a dead-end with this.

<p>Hmmm... maybe I should try trashing the Edgy partition and install FC6.

<hr>
    <p>Thu Apr  5 15:42:35 BST 2007</p>

    <p>Fiddling with GTk2 stuff today.  The whole residue tree stuff
    needs to be rewritten, as do the handlers for "Sort" button and
    "Filter" button on the file selection dialogs.</p>

    <p> Keeping both code paths is quite a challenge.  </p>

    <hr>  
   <p>Tue Apr  3 16:30:29 BST 2007</p>

   <p>Another intense day.  Great stuff.  Ramping up for 0.3 release.
   Final testing (well, hopefully final) this evening.</p>

   <p>After disussions on the guile-gtk mailing list, guile-gui is
   working.  Woop.  Thanks to Neil Jerram.  Now all I need to do is
   sort out the guile-gtk entries and then I think we can move over to
   GTK2.  For 0.4 perhaps?</p>
      
    <hr>
    <p>Mon Apr  2 18:14:12 BST 2007</p>
    
    <p>Now back to work... I can't remember the last time I could
    devote a whole day to coding... it's been ages!</p>
    
    <p>Some cool things added recently: "active" residue and template
    matching.  Just adding the finishing touches now...</p>
    
<hr>
<p>   Sun Apr  1  BST 2007</p>
 
 <p>Feisty Beta not bad actually.  I have to turn of DRI to stop it
 crashing when using Coot and of course Beryl won't work without DRI.
 But! The wireless works and the disk-access timeout has gone so
 that's a win.</p>
    
   <p>Have been CCP4 dev meeting this week, talking about Coot and
   HAPPy. Actually, the main developments of Coot this year were not
   on the agenda and not discussed.</p>
    
   <p>After meeting in York, it's a quick jaunt up to Newcastle.
   After an evening drinking cocktails with Martyn and Amy, it was a
   fairly relaxed CCP4 Roadshow the next day.</p>
    
    
<hr>
<p>Mon Mar 26 03:25:02 BST 2007</p>

<p>OK, let's give Feisty Beta a bash then...(glutton for punishment?)</p>


<hr>

<p>Fri Mar 23 12:55:57 GMT 2007</p>

<p>As I've said, there is some problem accessing the disk using Ubuntu
(Edgy) on my new laptop - for example, it takes 25 seconds to open a
new terminal each time.  Tedious.  And I couldn't configure the
trackpad so that it remains ridiculously sensitive. And running Coot
for more than 5 seconds crashed the machine hard.  As does running
Beryl. And the wireless doesn't work either.</p>

<p>So time to test a new version of Ubuntu, I though. Feisty Fawn Herd 5.</p>

<p>The partition manager has changed for the worse.  I tried to install on
a clean partition, but it was far to easy too accidental format the
current partitions.... and I fell into the trap.  So I have wasted my
machine this morning.  Baah. </p>

<p>OK... now where did I put that Edgy disk again...?</p>

<p>Now that I look at it Eugene has done all the hard work for "template"
(i.e. atom-tree/graph) based residue matching.  All I need to do it
pass it the residues and apply a LSQ to the matched atoms and bingo we
have a cool new ligand tool.</p>



<hr>
<p>19 March  2007</p>

<p>Been doing some fitting of beta strand for BCA talk in April.  It's
not too bad, a bit too slow though, so I need to rethink the
method.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fri Mar 16 2007</p>
<p>I installed Beryl on the laptop.  Yum!  I like wobbly windows.</p>


<hr>
<p>12 March  2007</p>

Back home.  I came back from that week's trip with 50 new items on the
TODO list (and an conservative estimate of 8 months to do them).</p>

<p>
And start to use new laptop in anger (a re-branded MSI MS-1034).  I
installed Ubuntu Edgy.  Very impressed with Open Office's ability to
read my PowerPoint presentation.  It's very fast at compiling Coot
(when it gets going).
</p>
<p>But on the downside... The disk access is very slow to get
started... often it is timing out for 10s of seconds before doing
anything.  The trackpad is annoyingly sensitive and too easy to
accidentally touch and move the cursor.  There is no middle-mouse
(crazy! this is not the 1990s anymore). Wireless doesn't work (I
didn't expect it to).  The graphics are not super fast (I get about 60
fps on the Coot Spin Test).  Those things are annoying enough, but the
overriding most irritating thing is the keyboard... it has a
numberpad! Which means that the important "," "." "/" "shift" and
"return" keys are small and squashed up together. Very often used keys
when doing Unixy stuff and easy to make typing mistakes. Very very
annoying.  Very.  It really makes me realise how slick my Mac keyboard
was.</p>
<p>
But machine problems aside, Ubuntu is very slick - Debian GNU/Linux
done right.</p>



<hr>
<p>8 March 2007</p>
<p>
And then Pharma-day at RTP. Got grilled again, but this time I had
some answers.  The post-add-terminal-fit refinement was a hit! Montana
Ted's for dinner (bison tenderloin complete with stars and stripes).
</p>

<hr>


<p>5 March 2007</p>


<p>And then it was Molprobity day... talking over with Ian Davis how the
coot<->molprobity interface should look.  We came up with a plan.  He
and Bryan also gave me the Richardson Rotamer library - but there is
some crazy issue with the carriage returns that I have to sort out
before I can begin to read it and then somehow bolt it into Coot.
This is quite a high priority now.  It'll be done for 0.4.</p>

<hr>

<p>4 March 2007</p>

<p>
Last time I went to a Phenix meet I was rushed off my feet.  I was
just as busy this time.  More industrial people and more people
interested/using Coot.  </p>

<p>
I'm still jet-lagged of course so I have about 3 hours every morning
to do some work in bed.  Phenix developers are not Coot users, it
turns out.  But they showed some enthusiasm after my presentation, and
I (at least) had fun working stuff up with them over the next day or
so.  Maybe they'll try it out a bit more by next time... small steps.
</p>
<p>So, more precisely, what I've been working on is adding the ability to
take instructions from another program.  The Phenix people have been
working on starting up the socket server and sending stuff down the
tubes.  We nearly got it working at the end.  One more hour required.
They have plans to convert PHIL objects into dialogs for Coot.  Sounds
interesting.
</p>

<p>At the meal on the last evening, Paul Adams ordered a very nice bottle
of Sancerre, which I was quietly making my way through.  I felt a
little guilty, it must be said, at enjoying more than my one eighth of
it.  I needn't have worried, because with a glass left in the bottle
(which I still, of course, had my eye on) Nigel Moriarty claimed with
aplomb, poured it into his glass and turned it into a rose (of sorts).
Heathen.</p>

<hr>

<p>2 March 2007</p>

<p>
I have been in the US this week.  After a unsocial start to the day
(3.30am) on Thursday the flight over to Washington was without
incident and we landed on time.  Unfortunately, the flight to Buffalo
was cancelled and so I was allocated a spot on the next flight - which
was then delayed 4 hours.  So lots of fun was had waiting for 7 hours
to fly to Buffalo.  Tum te tum....  It is very much easier to find
yourself somewhere to charge the laptop in Washington that UK
airports.
</p><p>
When I got to Buffalo, of course, my luggage wasn't there (what did I
expect?).  OK, so Chuck Weeks meets me at the airport and off we go
for tea and a (relatively) early night.  The hotel in Buffalo that
Chuck had arranged was The Mansion on Delaware.  Very good.  Excellent
staff (but American breakfast... which is fine if you like Danishes).
</p>
<p>The lecture and tutorials went down well, it seemed to me.  Perhaps
because everyone (me included) was drinking beer at Ulrich's at lunch
time.  I'm feeling a bit dry by the end.  Afterward an excellent
meal at Papaya (my favourite seared tuna followed by sizzling duck)
Eddy takes me to the airport and there I pick up my luggage with ease.
Then Saturday morning it's off to Washington again...
</p>
<p>The flight is bumpy on the way in and it's a bit blustery as we try to
land and after 2 seconds on the ground, the pilot has second thoughts
and we take of again to fly the loop for a new approach.  The second
time we make it down safely.</p>

<p>"And all that for no extra charge" said the pilot.  "Hohohoho" went
the customers - many of whom where throwing up.  That extra 20 minutes
delay means I miss my connecting flight to Raleigh/Durham.  Which
means a 4 hour wait in Washington.  Again.</p>

<p>And so to Phenix at Duke (chez Richardsons).</p>

    <p>I recently found out that the "passport for the US" thing was
    not as bad as I thought it was.  I can still go to the US on my
    current passport for a few more years...</p>

    <p>NCS code fixed.</p>

    <p>New SigmaA code added (not tested).</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Sat Sep 16 09:27:14 BST 2006

    <p>Went out to dinner last night (a leaving-do) in St. Clements.
    As I was waiting outside first went past Frank (vD) on his tandem
    looking for something to eat - this was unusual but not
    surprising.  Following Frank down the road was a sporty silver
    machine (a Ferrari Maronello perhaps?) with the number plate
    G1GGS.  Apparently it was the Boy Wonder himself (with friend).
    What was he doing in Oxford?  Surely he's due in Manchester on
    Sunday afternoon and will be kept busy there...

    <hr>
    <p>Sun Aug 27 11:46:47 BST 2006

    <p>Bug list is pretty much worked out.  Spent a couple of hours
    trying to make baton-building do something bad, but didn't manage
    it.  I think I'll give up with that bug (if it still exists).  So
    I think 0.1.2 is ready to go.  I'll play a bit more with it today
    and do the release tomorrow.  That is the plan.

    <p>While in York, I made some more progress on Intel Mac Coot
    (that is, continuing from the progress made at the Gordon
    Conference with the help of Serge Cohen (which made Coot compile,
    at least)).  There had been some low-level (glib) memory
    allocation problem on running the executable.  So I copied the
    patches for glib from fink and then gtk works - yahoo, we can see
    buttons.  So I then compiled coot... and that works. Well, nearly.
    Using the canvas (Ramachandran or validation tools) causes a
    crash.  Lynn Ten Eyck discovered and diagnosed problems with
    Imlib/gtk-canvas build too.  So, let's try a similar trick, update
    libtool, config.sub and config.guess (which enables the building
    of shared libraries) and get the patch from fink for the canvas
    too..  I've added that to the build script.  Don't know if it will
    work...

    <p>The results of using buccaneer on the output of refmac (where
    the phasing combined with the initial SAD phasing) was miserable.
    Buccaneer could do nothing good with the new (and supposedly
    improved) phasing. I told Kevin about it and he knows what to do
    (Kevin had been stuck with NCS in Pirate but it seems he's made a
    break-through recently - "(free) likelihood rocks!" he says).

    <hr>
    <p>Sun Aug 20 23:24:34 BST 2006 

    <p>Been on the train to York from Oxford.  I'd done an svn update
    on the laptop before I went which transfer the mods of a day or
    two.  I plugged in started the compile almost immediately I got
    on... and chug, chug it started compiling.  It didn't finish
    compiling until we were in Birmingham New St!  I then added 10 or
    so lines of code to store the position of the Ramachandran Plot
    and recompiled... and that didn't provide an executable until
    Sheffield!  RAD?  Not.  Time for a new laptop.

    <p>I've worked my way through the list of 19 bugs.  It's looking
    better.  Last thing to do is to further investigate the reported
    crashes on baton-building.  I've done some tests of baton-building
    via valgrind (it was tediously slow, of course (but forgivable
    because valgrind is just fantastic)) and it looks solid.  Another
    map/spacegroup/resolution may unearth the problem. 

    <p>Either way 0.1.2 is on the horizon.

    <p>The extension mechanism is working out sweetly.

    <p>I have found out (via a reply to the mailing list) how to
    compile guile 1.8 ("don't compile with debugging" - pretty
    surprisingly).  Anyway, version 1.8 had OS threads.  Super-cool.  I
    can have a separate thread waiting on commands coming down a
    socket.  Remote control is going to be sweeeet!  Doubly so if I
    can get one coot piping off commands down sockets to listening
    coots...  This is definitely what I would consider fun stuff, so I
    need to do more bug-fixing before I can play with that...

    <p>I also have a recurring nagging thought to do "something" with
    the URO interface.

    <p>I think of this set only Nicoll and co-workers are not on the
    Coot mailing list - which is a shame because my rate of successful
    communicating with previous Coot Citation Prize winners not on the
    Coot Mailing List is terrible.  Only 1 out of 5 or so.

    <p>So after the Gordon Conference, I met several others too
    (Boston, Raleigh, Philadelphia).  Again and again, I was asked
    questions the answers to which were in the documentation (and many
    not too, I should add in fairness).  So "try harder to make the
    answer clear in the GUI" is the take-home message.

    <p>I found out that baton building can all to easily crash and
    burn coot.  NCS copy-chain method failed during a demo.  Reverse
    CA chain method failed too.

    <p>Flying across London on the way to Heathrow is pretty
    spectacular (sadly misty on my flight, though).  It's sooo much

    <p>GRC finished (good meeting (of course)).  Some pharmas visited
    (lots of bugs/usability problems/feature-requests acquired) two
    sites to go, then I can go home.

    <p>One of the problems mentioned was the torsion angle
    identification (the confusion of the relation of the displayed
    bonds and the list of buttons).  Also, it was made clear that the
    rotatable bond needs to be "turned round" easily.

    <p>A solution to these issues has been worked out, I just need to
    code it up.

    <p>Thu Jul  6 01:02:59 BST 2006

    <p>Yesterday I got an email asking me if I was possible to put
    their own widgets/gui into the main Coot window... or must they
    say to their users that they need to "Calculate->Run Script".  I
    said (of course) that there was no way to do The Right Thing.  But
    my reply got me thinking: how hard was it actually...?
      
    <p>What we needed was access to the GtkWidgets created in C from
    the guile interface.  So, I took one more look at guile-gtk
    examples (I'd been toying with it on and off for many months) and
    this time, it just became clear to me what to do.  The critical
    file (coot.defs) turned out to be only 6 or so lines long.  A
    guile-gtk build program makes the glue code to create widgets
    accessible from guile (I had to code around a wrinkle in that both
    guile-gtk and swig were trying to create functions of the same
    name).  [Also the new guile-gtk (version 0.5) seems to cause Coot
    to crash, I am not certain this is the case yet and I have no idea
    why... so I went back to version 0.41].

    <p>That broke the back of the problem, then I had to work out the
    guile-gtk code needed to add a menu item and attach a callback to
    it.  But that didn't take too long and was all done in scheme. Now
    any one can do it! i.e. add menu items to the menu bar and call up
    widgets which look just the same as those built into Coot in
    C/C++.  Cool.  I think it's a big step forward for extenders of
    Coot (e.g. Joel's coops and Charlie's lazy script for a start).

    <p>On the HAPPy front, I am pondering what buccaneer will make of
    the output of refmac... (actually, it's not in HAPPy yet, it's an
    experimental scsh script). 

      <p> density-fit-by-residue has been extended with a couple of
      extra keywords so that we can now remove residues that fit the
      density particularly badly.

      <p>I wondered if refmac phasing would improve if I flooded with
      waters the parts of the structure that buccaneer had not built,
      but found the --flood option of findwaters didn't work properly.
      Baah. Must fix.

    <p>I am told that there is a new version of (Molprobity) probe out
    that outputs validation info in "Coot format" -- weeeeeh!

    <hr>
    <p>Tue Jul  4 00:00:05 BST 2006

    <p>Today the fffear problem was fixed.  It was due to atoms with a
    B-factor of 0.0 generating "nan" density.  This was because the
    model in this case (ideal B-form DNA) was generated by coot with
    B-factors of 0.0.  Ahem... :-).  So, both problems fixed.

    <p>A day or 2 ago committed a version of TestPhases for Happy to do
    (experimentally phased) map correlation to the reference map (for
    the test data-sets, obviously).  Which was good.

    <p>However, HAPPy, then went on to solve lysozyme in P 41 21
    2. Hmm...

    <hr>
    <p>Fri 30 June

    <p>Following message to Coot mailing list, I have added a widget
    to (text) search refmac monomer list.  It also allows the finding
    of monomers without full geometric description, which is of
    limited use, currently.

    <p>Not much Coot progress recently.  Pressure decreased after
    0.1.1 was released.  Slightly distracted by events in Germany.

    <p> Things to do before 0.1.2 release

    <ul>
      <li>Shelxl model delete alt conf problem
      <li>Restraints problem refining Cr in Ideal RNA
      <li>Bill Scott's RNA numbering problem
      <li>Coot FFFear sometimes makes a map with mean/std of nan

    <p>On the HAPPy front: Big (bad) news: Dan is leaving
    :-(. Baah. So we'll need someone else to work on that project.

    bugs reported during 6 days.  Baah.  I will need to release 0.1.2
    then.

    <p>Saw Tassos in a tie!  I've never seen the like...

    <p>On a spare afternoon, went with <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/como-granada-may-2006/medium/pict0222.jpg">Roberto</a> and Aldo
    to the Magritte exhibition at the <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/como-granada-may-2006/medium/pict0221.jpg">Villa Olmo</a>.

    <p>After Como, (a <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/como-granada-may-2006/medium/pict0228.jpg">misty morning in Milan</a>) thence onto Granada.  Met with Martin Caffrey (who
    has a crystallographer post-doc position available).

    <p>Went to the <a
    href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/como-granada-may-2006/medium/pict0245.jpg">a
    small village in the Sierra Nevada</a> for a walk in the foothills
    (<a

    On a whim during a 5 minute break on the bus trip up the mountain,
    I bought a newspaper (The Daily Telegraph, in fact) in the
    mountain village Orgiva... and coincidently it had an article
    about Chris Stewart ("Driving Over Lemons") who lives in Orgiva.

    <p>While there (Granada), visited La Alhambra.... absolutely
    packed with tourists, but I managed to get one or 2 <a

    <p>Oh, I just discovered that (of course) guile-gtk doesn't work

    <hr>
    <p>Thu 18 May 16:55:50 2006 BST</p>

    <p>Yay! I can get GTK2 to work... along with GNOME canvas and

    <p>Following in the steps of Lieven Buts, Bernhard Lohkamp and

    time" to use Coot.

    <p>As you can see, the depth-cueing is broken and the
    Chain/Residue Tree widget needs to be re-written, as does the file
    chooser (I don't want to use deprecated widgets).  There are other
    broken things too - but nevertheless, progress!

    <p> Did a Coot Tutorial yesterday for Martin Noble's "Protein
    Crystallography for graduates" course. We were using WinCoot 0.1.
    I've not used (or even seen) it before today.  It went mostly OK.
    Baton Building was the
    thing that the students found most difficult which, on reflection,
    makes sense because it is at that stage where you use experience
    of the shape of density and protein architecture to best place the
    C-alphas. </p>

    <p>I recently discovered a <a

    native Mac OS X</a>. I am not sure if the project is still alive,
    but it looks interesting.  If I can get it to work, that'll mean
    that I have no more need to keep the GTk1.2 interface and we can
    move to the Gtk2 interface more rapidly.

    <p>Wed 10 May 16:17:04 2006 BST 

    <p>OK! After a hard session valgrinding and gdbing, 0 residue

    <p>Tue May  9 14:30:22 BST 2006

    <p>OK, we have complementary bases on the RNA now.

    <p>When making the MS Visual Studio changes, I moved certain (c++
    function) declarations out of the interface file so they
    never seen by SWIG, so they dropped out of the scripting
    interface... most importantly <TT>(make-backup)</TT> was missing.
    Oh dear.  The pre-releases have been a bit hobbled in the last
    week or so.   Fixed now.

    <p>Yay!  I managed to get the matrices right to build the chains
    correctly.  Now everything is Guanine, and that needs to be fixed
    by some mutations, and that needs some rejigging of the base
    mutation code into the core libraries. I think I'll sketch out a
    GUI before I do that.</p>

    <p>Fri May  5 11:26:18 BST 2006</p>

    <p>This week I've been working on Happy, adding a method to score
    the quality of the phase set by comparison against the reference
    set (those of the solved structure). </p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Dan's been adding a very cute GUI.</p>

    <p>Coot-wise, Kleywegt Plots have been licked into shape (at long
    last!), and I've eventually found the mechanism to pan the zoomed
    Ramachandran/Kleywegt Plots.  Hoorah. Perhaps I should now add a
    zoom button to these plots... I've made some progress with making
    an ideal RNA model.</p>

    <p>Fixed a relatively obscure bug (crash) when using 2 sequence
    views for the same molecule (you can't do that now).

    <p>Also added a ton of small fixes/additions for MS Visual Studio
    build.

    <p>Bernie announced WinCoot 0.1 yesterday.  Hoorah!</p>

    <p>On the downside, I got a report about missing P 32 symmetry in the
    current version - sigh...</p>

    <p>Went south for the Bank Holiday Weekend.</p>

    <p>Did some fossil hunting at the base of Black Ven. Saw the <a

    href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~gcaselton/fossil/photo-gc.html">Golden
    Cap</a>.  This picture reminds me of "The Algebraist" (which is my
    favourite book of the last 2 years).</p>

    <p>Also took in Stonehenge. I took some hyperstereo images <a
    href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/dorset-april-2006/hyperstereo-stonehenge.jpg">here</a> is the best one.  Ideally it should
    have been taken using 2 cameras using manual exposure setting. The
    stones were about 30m away and the separation was about 3 metres,
    so the view is overly hyper.  Also, these were taken pretty late
    in the day, so the sun is in the wrong place for this view. Better
    next time, I hope.  (But don't let me put you off too much though,
    if you can do cross-eyed stereo they are an amusing diversion).

    (supposedly) I can read the contact info on the fly.  I had a bash
    at this, but it is not very good (I don't really know what in the
    output I am looking for) and may fail for atoms that have 2-letter
    element attribute.

    <p>Created a generic "box of buttons for interesting things"
    (interesting-things-gui).  It can be provided with a list of
    places or atom specs (or a mixture). The button label tells the
    user what was interesting. Useful for external projects, perhaps.

    <p>Compiled gcc 4.1.0 and used that.  I found one extra
    qualification that I had not previously removed - apart from that
    it compiled fine.  But it crashed when trying to Autoread an MTZ
    file.  I think I have heard of such a crash before.  It seems I
    might be able to track it down now.

    <p>Back in York.  Had RNA discussions with Kevin.  Kevin will do
    experimental map fitting as an extension to his current Buccaneer
    method and I will do ideal A-form RNA, sugar pucker changer and
    perhaps addition of 2'3' cyclic phosphate for the 3' end.

    <p>Got a nice bug report from Erik Vogan and as a result cleaned
    up all the dangerous string matching code in coot.  

    <p>People are beginning to use mactels and finding problems in
    Coot (well, Coot dependencies). David Gohara posted a patch to
    CCP4 for gtk-canvas, I haven't evaluated it yet.  Charles Ballard
    and I are discussing a patch to the canvas image lib to fix a
    different crash.

    <p>I fixed a bug (silly typo) that make the link torsion
    refinement fail.  This has been a long-standing bug. So now link
    torsion angle restraints work - so we can set target phi, psi and
    omega restraints... which means some nice tricks are on their way.

    <p>Tues Apr 4
    <p>Release 0.1

    <p>I messed up the python code dependency in one file though, so
    it doesn't compile --with-python.

    <p>I also forgot to put the reference-structures and monomer
    library in place.  So I have updated the build script to do that.

    <p>Several calls for Mactel Coot.

    <p>Dear Apple, please send me a Mactel PowerBook - I need it.

    <p>Sun Apr  2 21:20:50 BST 2006

    <p>Major reworking of the build system to use ccp4 libs 5.0.2.

    <p>Final tinkering before release.  Nucleotides now have
    dictionary-based mechanism to know that they can have a
    phosphodiester linkage.

    <p>Back from the CCP4 developer meeting.</p> 

    <p>Posted a <a
    href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/2006-march-berkeley/">few
    pictures</a> from the Phenix Workshop in Berkeley (the Bay Bridge
    is not so ugly at night...).  The large size prints from <a
    href="http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/gallery/gal013.html">kite
    photography</a> of the Sather Campanile at the Oakland Museum were
    impressive.</p>

    <hr>Sat Mar 25 02:27:05 PST 2006

    <p>Working part of Berkeley trip is over now.  Some reflections
    then:

    <p>I found out that CCP4 has changed its licence for the libraries
    so that it is now incompatible with the LGPL.  This was a
    surprising.  All the months I've been messing with building new
    CCP4 libraries for Coot seem to be for nothing.  Baah.

    <p>At the Phenix Workshop, as well as a day of formal
    presentations, there were a couple of days set aside just for
    developers to sit together and discuss/chat/eat pretzels.  This
    turned out to be very valuable (I was pretty busy those days).
    CCP4 should definitely do something like this too.

    <p>Phenix and CCP4 have several areas in which development is
    overlapping.

    <p>It seemed (to me, at least) that Jane Richardson was in favour
    of optimizing the Ramachandran Plot as part of model building
    (many people have asked me to include such a thing in Coot and I
    have planned to do it).  This of course stops the plot being
    useful for validation, but makes the resulting structure more
    likely.

    <p>Jane Richardson hosted a sub-meeting about RNA fitting in
    experimental maps.  It seems that FFFear searching RNA "rotamer
    suites" will be an interesting approach. TT may well beat us to do
    something about it though.  Kevin and I are pretty busy already.
    But if we do do something, it will have been strongly inspired by
    this chat.

    <p>Just like Thomas Schneider, Nigel Moriarty wanted a "no startup
    script" argument.  Loading up the Phenix environment in "Coot
    enhanced by Python" and using PyGtk for the GUI seemed to work OK,
    so this looks like the way things will develop on the Coot/Phenix
    integration front.

    <p>I shoe-horned in an interface to molprobity's probe so that you
    get contact dots as you rotate a chi angle for a residue (just
    like you can in KiNG).

    <p>Friday afternoon, set aside for sight-seeing and it poured with
    rain.  Dinner at Spenger's was good though.

    <p>Fly back this afternoon, arrive home on Sunday afternoon, one
    day to rest, then CCP4 Automation meeting in York on Tuesday and
    after that the developers meeting...

    <p> Am in Berkeley now.  Very picturesque as I walk to breakfast
    in the morning, looking over the Berkeley marina to the bay, with
    the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.  Ahem... well, I am
    supposed to be doing some work here.  I had a long talk with the
    Richardsons and I think I can add into Coot a few of the things
    that they have in King.  I remember Frank von Delft's reaction to
    Jane's presentation at the 2004 Gordon Conference.  Having these
    features in Coot will be just like that.

    <p> I spent some time trying to read in the Penultimate Rotamer
    Library.

    <p>Good day today.  Fixed the last of GMS's SHELXL-related
    problems, fixed the problem with symmetry atom recentring.  We are
    on the home straight, I think.  Tinkered with the coot home page
    images.

    <hr>

    <p>Tue 15 Mar 2006 GMT

    <p>Fixed Bill Scott's problem of refining nucleotides.  This
    problem has been there for ages (since carbohydrate linkages were
    introduced) and only just reported.

    <p>George Sheldrick has given me a list of SHELXL-related things
    to fix.

    <p>I've been hearing from a few people the the symmetry display is
    not fixed because they get grey molecules over their main
    molecule.  Oh dear.

    <p>Sat Mar 11 16:03:55 GMT 2006
    <p> Got back from Barcelona on Tuesday night - the flight was
    timed perfectly to miss every second of the Barca Chelsea match.

    <p>Next day up to Glasgow to pack up household and move out
    (at long last?).  

    <p>Last night I had a lovely Ashoka (Ashton Lane) curry.  Yum...
    It will be a long while before I have another one.  Tonight is my
    last night of officially being Glaswegian.

    <p>Just been to dinner with Andrei.  He was explaining (or trying
    to explain) that we live in a largely 3 dimensional universe,
    because that is the universe of "most harmony", where the number
    of Platonic solids is maximized.  In higher dimensions you can
    only have hypercubes (and hyperspheres, I imagine, but he didn't
    mention them).

    <p>But then again, we'd been drinking quite a lot of beer after
    quite a long day...

    <p>Tutorials in the morning, then free afternoon and evening.
    Tutorials went pretty well, I thought (sharing them with Kevin)
    and in the afternoon, I worked on phs support that Isabel had
    asked for (to view the results of the free lunch algorithm) and
    then went to see <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/barcelona-2006/medium/PICT0185.JPG">Las Ramblas</a> and <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/barcelona-2006/medium/PICT0187.JPG">the Sagreda Familia</a>.

    Pictures are now <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/2006-mar-barcelona/">here</a>.

    <p>Jorge Navaza is here.  I feel guilty for not working enough on
    URO interface.

    <p>George Sheldrick is here.  I feel guilty for not working enough
    on the SHELXL interface.

    <p>Paul Adams is here. I feel guilty for not working enough on the
    Phenix interface.

    <p>Martin Winn is here.  I feel guilty for not working enough so
    that Coot 0.1 could be released with CCP4 6.0.

    <p>Coming back from dinner (at Mango, I think it was called, I can
    say that the duck magret tasted good, but I don't approve of the
    way it is made) feeling that I was just a smidgen away from a
    working SHELXL interface, I thought I could fix it in the few
    minutes before I went to bed. Ha!  3 hours later... it may be
    working!  Tired now.  Well, that makes a change doesn't it?

    <p>I am having fun snarfing documentation from coot's scheme
    functions.  The are being turned into texinfo so there can be an
    HTML page as well as printed documentation.  On reflection, this
    is really procrastination.  What I should be doing is compiling
    CCP4 libraries.  But it's just too depressing...

    <p>Still have some pain...

    <p>Continuing problems with CCP4 libs.  There is a lot of work to

    <p>I just bought myself some Logitech X-530 speakers.  I am
    listening to them as I type this.  They are good, much better than
    what I had been listening to - crisp clean sound, not boxy and
    impressively deep base.  Motorcycles (The Orb, Ultraworld 9) sound
    realistic for the first time. Not all the speakers are working
    however (using Fedora Core 4) I can't hear the centre speaker (but
    maybe that is how it's supposed to be, I am just listening to
    normal music, not a video).

    <p>I like that the mute button on my (Logitech) keyboard works
    with XMMS, no matter which application has focus.

    <p>I wonder if I have appendicitis.

    <p>Just played an evening's Great Dalmuti - lots of chat, having
    to explain the rules and bizarre hold-up play by the 1 (Dalmuti)
    holders made it difficult for me to count the cards.  Also
    somewhat distracted by continuing abdominal pain. I didn't become
    Dalmuti even once - not even a lesser one.  Baah.

    <p> Debugging consists (to some extent) of trying to compile
    modern Coot on (my) Macintosh using the build-it autobuilder
    script.  But this is not possible because the CCP4 ftp server that
    provides the basic libs is offline because it had been hacked
    recently - argh!

    <p>Well, what with the symmetry problems being fix, and the
    unintentional rotamers for Hydrogens going away, I thought I'd
    celebrate by doing some work that I enjoy doing (bug fixing, I do
    not enjoy, particularly).  So (prompted by Tom Transue, it must be
    said) I have been playing with interfacing reduce and probe from
    the Richardson's <a
    href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/">Molprobity</a> suite.
    What fun!  And I think it make another useful validation tool.  <a

    <p> Long time no update!

    <p><a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> is just fantastic.
    What a program.  I found (and fixed) a very tricky memory leak and
    uninitialized variable cond jump.  Now symmetry is more robust.  I
    am pleased with symmetry display now.  The symmetry code in Coot
    is actually complex (hard to program) and sophisticated (fast,
    complete (you can go anywhere in the "crystal" and there will be
    symmetry atoms)).

    <p> Which leaves only symmetry atom pick as a major flaw to be
    fixed before release.

    These days I have been attending the 2nd International Symposium
    on Recent Trends in Macromolecular Structure and Function, in Chennai
    India.  (Chennai renamed itself from Madras in 1996, the previous
    name being considered "too Portuguese").  In my ignorance, I didn't 
    know that (Doubting) Thomas died here.

    <p>
    As I lie here, once more not able to sleep, I reflect on the trip.
    The meeting finished last night.  Tired, I was by the end.

    <p>
    We (Garib and I) met Tom Terwilliger and Paul Adams at Heathrow.

    <p>
    I met again some people that I'd met in Bangalore.  It was nice to 
    meet Peter again.  I need to catch up on my "Lost" episodes.

    <p>
    I took some photos (and some of the audience) and I wanted to show
    them, but there was not the time to do so. So you can see them <a
    href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/pictures/chennai-2006/">here</a>. 

    <p>We went the beach that was hit by the tsunami last year.  
    Apparently the waves were 20m high when they hit the beach 
    and travelled 1km inland.

    <p>Udo Heinemann and others said that don't like getting
    cis-peptides when they refine.... OK, OK... I will do something
    about it!
    
    <p>
    Raj told me that people had been coming up to him and telling him
    how much they liked his program, Coot.  I was amused.

    <p>
    The food was good, although not as spicy as I'd imagined.  I ate 
    almost exclusively vegetarian. If I missed breakfast though (which 
    was spicy) I was desperate to eat by 11am.  Strange.

    <p>
    The invited speakers stayed in th GRT Grand, that along with the 
    venues for the hosted dinner, the Paradise Towers were
    uncharacteristic of other Chennai buildings and reminded me of 
    the good-quality hotels that are used for the ACA.  The mosquitoes
    are much less of a problem than I thought that they'd be.  Still, 
    I don't think I'd be as relaxed if it wasn't for Jungle Juice.

    <p>
    I learn that York are getting one of the first Oxford Diffraction 
    Xcalibur Novas.  Sound good.
 
    <p>
    I have been able to download mails and see that Dan has been making
    lots of commits.  Using the phaser option he got gilu (one of the Jolly 
    SAD structures) phases in which ARP/wARP built 99% of the residues.

    <p>
    Later today, we are are going to something called Crocodile Bank.  
    Sounds interesting.  I should try to get some sleep then.

    <p>Dan has moved the directory structure for happy to a database
    node form.  Com/Log files seem more hidden.  Maybe we will need
    some results-finding utilities...

    <p>Kevin helped me out with doxygen documentation (obscure \file
    directive needed).  I've documented 50 or so functions so far.
    Several hundred still to go...  I will fix up the post-install
    script soon so that new documentation get put on the web
    (automatically).

    <p> libccp4c packaging system worked nicely.  Have fully resolved
    libs now.  Also removed from coot code that used deprecated
    mmdbold.  But MacCoot still crashes. Argh.

   <hr>
   <p>I just found out that the Finnish in World War II used the word
   Höyryjyr (Steamroller) to detect spies.  It is spectacularly
   difficult for anyone other than a true native Finnish speaker to
   pronounce it correctly - maybe even Linus Torvalds would get it
   wrong.  Wikipedia is a wonderful thing.

    <p>Just back from CCP4 Study Weekend - in somewhat of a state of
    depression - just amazing how Tom Terwilliger can keep churning
    out super-spectacular results... while listening to his
    presentation I was thinking 'is there any point in me saying
    anything?' - Baah.  Or maybe it's just a lack of sleep.

    <p>We had a lunchtime bytes session.  Bernie earned his keep (but
    lost his voice - almost) and did the actual presentation.  It was
    noisy with no projector, it was difficult to see and hear, so the
    the crowd maxed out at about 12 people.

    <p> At study weekend, I spoke to Charles Ballard about library
    problems on Mac OS X.  He introduced me to make_install_name.  I
    tried it, and it changed things somewhat, but it didn't make the
    program work.

    <p>So I have a new approach - package up libccp4c like any other
    package - so that it gets a .a, .dylib and .la like any other
    library.  Fingers crossed that will do the trick - compiling as I
    type this...

    <p>Some feedback at the SW:  

    <ul>

      <li>Several compliments - which was nice.</li>

      <li>Low-key complaints about the documentation of the scripting
      interface.  I think the scripting interface is super-powerful,
      but hardly used by anyone other than me.  I will see if
      improving the documentation of the scripting interface will be
      useful.  Doxygen to the rescue? (so far, no success, but we'll
      see what Kevin says).</li>

      <li>Criticism about the handling of Chiral Volumes,</li>

      <li>Adrian Lapthorn said that the handling of NCS was "crap",</li>

      <li>Mac-using coot users want .dmg install,</li>

      <li>Several people want "tor_general".  Hmm...</li>

    <p>Dan and I made some more plans for HAPPy.  Good, good.

    <hr>
    <p> Wed Jan 4 03:28:40 GMT 2006 

    <p> Dan came back to work today, so it turned into something of a
    HAPPy day as we discussed a few things and got emma to transform
    the heavy atom sites according to the deposited structure.  So in
    our first test case (GerE), I measured the correlation coefficient
    at 50.33% - not fantastic.  In fact I'd say it was untraceable.
    Kevin says that it is better to measure the correlation of the E
    maps rather than the F maps, so we need to do a bit more coding
    for that.

    <p> Bashing on Coot bugs continues. I begin to see light at the
    end of the tunnel.  Coot 0.1 available before February, I hope.

    cases that I have examined).

    <p>Been bashing away at Coot bugs since I got up today.  The biggy
    was the chi angles of the proline (and wow, is it involved!) 
    ... I've been working on this so intently that I've forgotten to
    eat.. only now do I realise that I'm a bit peckish.

    <hr>
    <p> Fri Dec 30 19:56:03 GMT 2005
    <p> It's been a while since I've updated this.

    <p> Coot is still in a state of fragility on my Mac. Baah.

    <p> I am thinking about the ligand presentation at the CCP4
    meeting in Leeds.  Thinking only - I haven't actually done
    anything yet... time is getting short.

    <p> I've been working on the interface to ShelxL.  Bashing it into
    shape and talking to GMS.  Also bashing into shape the post-SSM
    alignment code.

    <p> I want to put some pictures of Nepal on the web.  The need to
    be sorted out and made into web page(s).

    <p> I went to <a href="diary/spey-bay.jpg">Spey Bay</a> on Boxing
    Day and saw <a href="diary/grey-seal.jpg">grey seals</a>.  I lost
    my lens cap there.  Baah.

    <p> Arranging things for trip to India in January... must get a
    visa soon though.

    <p> I think I might make a double-headed coot image to replace the
    Dec (Christmas) splash screen.

    <p> On the Happy side of things, Dan and I have been incorporating
    CCTBX's emma.  We can now test if the sites match the
    prior-knowledge of where the anomalous scatterers should be.  This
    means that we use cctbx python, rather than standard python.

    <p>Bernhard came over just before Christmas and we bashed away on
    Coot code under WindowsXP.  Then I merged the code back into the
    main branch.  It should be a lot easier for him to make the
    WinCoot binaries now.

    <hr>
    <p>Thu Dec  1 04:56:09 GMT 2005
    <p>Back from Nepal.  Catching up with mail now.

    <p>Coot currently in a state of very brokenness.  I don't know
    why!  I can't get it to read any data without crashing.  This is
    related to using the new CCP4 libs.

    <hr>
    <p>Mon Nov 14 16:31:56 GMT 2005

    <p> Much pain installing coot on Macintosh.  Argh!  Frustration.
    I must stream-line the installation.

    <hr>
    <p>Mon Nov 14 05:16:21 GMT 2005
    
    <p>Thomas Schneider wants to run Coot from hkl2map and asked for
    an option to stop it asking about startup script.  So I've just
    done that.

    <p>libtool problem fixed by copying over an ltmain.sh from an old
    coot (0.0.30 or so).

    <hr>
    <p> Sun Nov 13 22:04:37 GMT 2005

    <p> Am at M2M course in Hamburg.  Unexpectedly pleasant.  Nice
    Hotel. Spent this evening in an Italian restaurant chatting to
    Serge Cohen.  Lots of Macs here.  I need to install new version
    (well, 0.0.33) for MolRep tutorial tomorrow.

    <p> Much pain with libtool on compiling svn version of Coot for
    Mac.  Urgh.  I had hoped that the files generated from FC4 auto
    tools would be OK when transfered to Mac... apparently not.

    <p> Haven't had much to do yet.  There are a few coot-users
    here. I've chatted to a few people and done some coot tinkering.
    Several other people from York (the Refmac team) are here.

    <p> We are quite a way behind with HAPPy, but I am glad, at least
    that we decided to go for SAD first, after talking to Raj.  I
    really must interface BP3.  OK.... Will do at next available
    moment (some time in February).  

    <p> I can't yet find any mention of the forthcoming meeting in
    Madras to which I am supposed to be invited...

    <hr>
    <p> Fri Nov 11 10:06:22 GMT 2005

    <p> People like Dalmuti (especially those who most often are
    Dalmuti :-).  As Great Dalmuti I deliberately lost (by playing off
    the top when leading) and went down to Greater Peon.  No-one
    noticed that that was odd.

    <hr>
    <p>Tue Nov  8 13:33:00 GMT 2005

    <p> I typed in "Happy Coot" to google and second link was a cute
    picture of a happy coot :-) I wrote to Harri Vainola and now I can
    make a cartoon based on his image.  I am having fun playing about
    with the image, but it will be a while before the result makes it
    to the splash screen.

    <p> Urgh.  The installation of that CCP4-libs-based coot exe did
    indeed cause screams.

    <p> Still having painful problems with the CCP4
    libraries. Sigh... very depressing.

    <hr>
    <p> Mon Nov  7 13:09:01 GMT 2005

    <p> Well, the build works for Fedora Core 3, but fails on Darwin,
    with some sort of fortran configuration problem.  Batted the
    problem over to Peter Briggs.

    <p> Played Dalmuti last night... was quite well received.

    <p> OK, Peter has done stuff with ccp4's configure.  I'll have to
    see which patches are still relevant in the morning.

    <p> Going through my "TODO before the next release" list now.

    <p>I've made available the CCP4-libs-based coot exe in York
    now... let's see if this causes screams :-)

    <p> Just had some more vaccinations for Nepal trip.
    
    <p> Going through my "TODO before the next release" list now.

    <hr>
    <p> Sun Nov  6 14:33:30 GMT 2005

    <p> I committed the changes.  I needed a few rounds to get the
    autobuilder working. It does for bubbles now, we'll see if it does
    for the others tomorrow.

    <p> The mtz column label changes required extra (unexpected)
    munging of molecule name strings for the display manager.

    <p> OK, I hope I can put this to bed.  Now back to more
    conventional programming... FVARs and Occupancy fixes for
    shelx.res file springs to mind...

    <hr>
    <p> Sat Nov  5 15:43:45 GMT 2005

    <p> Big effort over the past 3 or 4 days to move to CCP4
    distribution of libs (fftw, cmtz, cmap, mmdb, clipper).  Lots of
    code shuffled and re-written. I will commit the changes when I
    have things in order. Now we have xtal/dataset info in the mtz
    column label chooser.  Today I am sorting out the build system.

    <p> I bought Dalmuti, yay!

    <hr>
    <p>Tue Nov 1 10:37:09 GMT 2005

    <p> I ran autogen.sh for the first time on kalypso. Lots of
    complaining about my macros.  I installed (copied over) new
    lt-main.sh, config.sub, config.guess.  Big fixes.  The compilation
    has changed.  Fingers crossed it will work on other systems :-)

    <p> The rebuild of 0.0.33 didn't do the job.
   
    <p>And now George Sheldrick has written to me complaining about
    glutInit().  Damn.

    <hr>
    <p>Sun Oct 30 10:21:21 GMT 2005

    <p>I found the problem of the Red Hat builds (it was putting the
    final tar files on a local disk, not the disk that can bee seen by
    http).  Hopefully, this will put an end to the glutInit problems.

    <p> Not motivated to do much work today (still tired, I guess).
    I'd like to have a bash at the FVARs for shelx output at some
    stage soon though, I was thinking about how to do it at the
    airport.

    <p> I used Pymol (semi-)seriously for the first time at the
    workshop in Gif.  I really liked the view system.  I think Coot
    need a version of it.  I use quaternions to handle the view and I
    think I can "just" do a spherical interpolation of them to move
    smoothly between views like PyMol does.  Anyway, that's something
    for the back-burner.  

    <hr> 
    <p>Sat Oct 29 21:23 BST 2005
    <p>Yay! Home.
    <p>I eat baked beans for tea and will go to bed early.

    <p>Daylight saving off tonight.  Dark evenings for next 6 months -
    baah.

    <hr> 
    <p>Sat Oct 29 14:55:34 BST 2005

    <p> Well, there seems to be a problem with the rebuild of 0.0.33
    tars.  The redhat 8 version didn't get built.  I didn't have time
    to investigate why.

    <p> I am at the airport now (Charles De Gaulle) and bored.  I
    should have got an earlier flight, perhaps.  I nearly fell asleep
    on the RER over here.

    <p> Some things to do on Coot for Jorge's URO team.  Hopefully it
    can mostly be done with scripting.

    <p> 4 hours before I'm home...

    <hr> 
    <p>Sat Oct 29 06:22:27 BST 2005

    <p> (Relatively) lots of activity on the coot mailing list these
    days.  I am getting several reports about freeglut initialization
    errors.  Oh dear.  I'll try to rebuild the 0.0.33 binaries by
    removing the 0.0.34-pre-release source code tar file... that
    should do it I hope.

    <p> Moving from 0.0.33 to 0.0.34 makes 0-coot.state.scm files
    fail.  I suppose that means a change in the minor version.

    <p>I have lots to do for EM support.  As I mentioned, for the week
    or so before coming to Paris (and off and on while I've been here)
    I'be been trying to add a fffear interface into Coot (with Kevin's
    help, of course).  I didn't manage to sort out the application of
    the transformation operator needed to place the resulting
    molecules by the time of my (final) presentation and the current
    interface was scorned ("the result is a *map*!?").  Fffear is
    (very) slow compared to other methods that use rotation function
    filtering (to place molecules in EM maps).  Maybe this is
    something we can think about.

    <p>After 5 16 hour days, I am exhausted and sleep-deprived.

    <p>We have 2 x (about) 2 hour meals each day (I don't do
    breakfast).  Every meal is served with a portion of lollo-rosso
    and dressed salad and (at least) one sort of creamy thing and a
    cheese course.  Enough.

    <p> When I get home I want to eat some proper food.  Beans on
    toast.

    <p> Yesterday it rained all day but the day before that (the 27th)
    was beautiful - crisp, clear, warm.  

    <p> Mars is very bright these days (and higher in the sky than I
    remembered it last year).

    <p> Fingers crossed I will be home (in 12 hours as I write this).
    And now I hear banging doors and other activity which means that
    it's almost time to get up again...

    <hr>
    <p>Wed Oct 26 23:47:39 BST 2005 

    <p>In Paris this week (well, Gif-sur-Yvette) at the EMBO course on
    combining X-ray and EM structure solution methods organized by
    Jorge Navaza.

    <p>Unfortunately, I have to miss the World Series to be here. I
    notice that Chicago White Sox are 3-0 up and playing tonight.

    <p>I heard about URO for the first time.  The interface looks a
    lot like Amore did :-0

    <p> Many late nights and early mornings.  Much tiredness.  But I
    managed to sneak in a siesta today so I am feeling much better.  

    <p> Alwyn Jones is here too and I spoke to him (I was sitting next
    to him at dinner).  I didn't know just how big a Mac fan he is (I
    can't compete, but I am typing this on a Mac, I'll have you know).

    <p>I gave a little tutorial last night which went down quite well
    it seems (from the (little) feedback I got).

    <p>I am desperately trying to get Fffear to work from within Coot
    so that I can talk about it on Friday.  Making slow progress (and
    it accounts, to some extent, for my tiredness).  I haven't managed
    to make it to breakfast in time yet.  Hopefully I can do some
    pictures of the place before I leave (the Chateau looks nice).

    <p>I realise that I've been doing something totally daft with the
    nightly pre-release binaries.  Oh dear.  What have people been
    using.  No wonder they complain to me about glutInit problems.
    They are using old exes.  Urgh.

    <p> OK... another late night... I must go.

    <p> 20th citation for the Coot paper from Wim Hol's group.

    <p> I am in York this week.  Steven Ness has been here.  Been
    having discussions/meetings.  Databases and XML.

    <p> I talked to Kevin and we made some progress on the Coot
    interface to FFFear.  Still doesn't work yet, though.  Previous
    problem was indeed a clipper bug.  A bug that he'd fixed over a
    year ago.  Hmmm... must update clipper...

    <p> CCP4 6 will be released in the foreseeable future.  I'd like to
    be compatible when it happens.

    <p> Had another bash at reading SHELX input.  Better now.  Still
    problems with hydrogen name that need investigating.

    <p> Werewolves (of Miller's Hollow) is a big hit with the game
    players.  Had a marathon 6 hour session on Saturday night (oh to
    have Dalmuti too!).  Now my sleeping pattern is disturbed.  Still
    not played Modern Art here yet.

    <p> Apparently the publishers of (The Great) Dalmuti will do a new
    printing this year - so says the owners of the Gameskeeper in
    Cowley Road.

    <p> Train to York Sunday night - marathon 6 hour journey.  Up
    early for Monday morning.

    <p> Symmetry control widget looks good.  Now working on NCS
    control widget.

    <p>Been trying to add fffear functionality. Not as easy as I
    thought it was going to be (well, is it ever..?).  Been tripping
    up on a NXmap access bug.  I have asked Kevin about it.  I have a
    feeling that it may be due to out of date clipper libs... urgh.

    <p>There has been some chat on the cootbb today/yesterday about
    linkages.  Should I give a technical answer... Hmm...

    <hr>
    <p>Tue Oct 11 11:54:48 BST 2005
    <p> Yahay!  Got my mail back.

    <p> Yesterday and today I have been moving symmetry configuration
    back out to the molecule (rather than having "global" symmetry
    parameters)... which involved much recompiling. (There is also a GUI).

    <p> I am thinking of making the next version 0.1.0 because there
    are so many changes.  I will change to new version of clipper too.

    <p> Carbohydrate linkages (with distance check to "auto-determine"
    the linkage type) enabled.  Cute.  I've wanted this for a long
    time. [Handling glycosylation is still a long way off, though.]

    <p> I read CCP4BB today, someone wanted to use maprot to transform
    their map for a figure and had a problem.  "This should be
    available in Coot" I thought.  So I took about an hour and did
    it. It's a straightforward use of the clipper map and grid
    objects:

    <p> <tt>transform-map</tt> is the name of the function.

    <p> Currently been stalled on the WinCoot front.  I can't get
    gtkglarea to configure.  pkg-config seems to be needed for
    configure to work, but I can't get it to tell me anything useful
    about gtk...

    <p> Been to do a presentation at <a
    href="http://www.pfizer.co.uk/template4.asp?pageid=99">Pfizer
    Sandwich</a> (their website is terrible IMHO - it renders badly in
    Mozilla and fails on the basic things like giving directions how
    to get to the site).

    <p> Been to Cambridge and back for the weekend.

    <p> Am trying out Stuart's new mgtree code.  Still doesn't work :-(

    <p> Am adding Symmetry control widget in the meantime (as
    requested by Frank von Delft).

    <p> Also, now as a fall-back Coot looks for anomericity in the
    file names when auto-loading restraints dictionaries.  Which means
    that carbohydrates dictionaries can be read.

    <p> I put Kevin's helix axis searching engine (finding cylinders
    of density) into the helix-fitting code.  It works slower now -
    but better.

    <p>Mon Sep 19 18:26:14 BST 2005

    <p> These days are bug fixing days. Somewhat tedious.  Have
    re-written water finding code using a STL list of clusters instead
    of the usual STL vector, fixed alt conf bonding problems, flying
    carbohydrate problems, flip residue sidechain problems...

    <hr>
    <p> Thu Sep 15 22:28:58 BST 2005
    <p> Still waiting for mgtree...
    <p> NCS Master chain to others function implemented and documented.

    <p> On an off moment, I fixed the problems with the George
    Sheldrick tutorial solution.  It runs in 4.5 seconds on my mac
    (and 1.8s on the new PC).  I regret that I missed the discussions
    of the solutions at the end of the Computing School.

    <p> Gebhard Schertler says he may have some spare sgi dials he can
        lend me... woo hoo!  Now I may be able to get David Gohara's
        code interfaced.

    <p> Implemented and documented reversing direction of fragment code.

    <p> BT have messed about with their mail system so I haven't been
    able to reply to the Coot mailing list questions.

    <p> Been to Manchester this week (and have been mostly out of
    touch) a meeting to celebrate 25 years of the SRS (now to be shut
    down in 2008).  The best bit, I thought was the microfocus
    satellite.

    <p> Kevin and I have been playing with helix fitting code over the
    previous few days.  Looks interesting.  I have put a button to
    exercise the code into the Coot GUI.  It doesn't alway work,
    though.

    <p> I found a bug in the rigid body refinement code.  Maybe this
    will fix the slowness on the SGI and the problem with add terminal
    residue too often making wrongly placed additions.  Not sure yet.

    <hr>
    <p> Tue Aug 30 19:25:52 CEST 2005 
    <p> IUCr is over for another 3 years.  I'm going home tomorrow.

    <p> I am told that Wim Hol and Titia Sixma had nice things to say
    about Coot in their presentations.  I am very sad to say that I
    missed both of them.

    <p> Tue Aug 30 08:25:52 CEST 2005 

    <p> Still waiting for mgtree fix...

    <p> I've been asked a few times for a screen capture function and
    when I've said "why don't you use the Raster3D function?" they say
    "What Raster3D function?"  So, OK, that's going into the gui now.

    <hr>
    <p> Mon Aug 29 09:45:17 CEST 2005 

    <p> I have been asked a few times "what's next for Coot?"  So this
    is what I have in mind for the next few months, in no particular
    order:

    <ul>
      <li>Update to CCP4 libraries rather than mccp4
      <li>Add dial-usage code (using David Gohara's dials library)
      <li>Shelx read/write .ins/.res files
      <li>WinCoot should build without modification
      <li>Optionally build with GTk2 like Lieven Buts has done
      <li>Chiral volume targets in refinement
      <li>Ramachandran targets in refinement (controversial feature to
      improve the look of Ramachandran plots)
      <li>Investigate side by side stereo
      <li>Peptide omega graph should update like the others
      <li>Pre-pro Ramachandran plot
      <li>Add Terminal Residue often fails - why is that?
      <li>Fast non-bonded contacts in refinement
      <li>Find Waters often misses what seem to be good waters - why is that?
      <li>sequence assignment
    </ul>

    <p>There will be less time-consuming things like GUI improvements,
    crash fixes going on too, of course.

    <hr>
    <p> Fri Aug 26 11:34:06 CEST 2005

    <p> I have been at the IUCr in Florence (or should I say
    "Firenze") and the Computing School satellite meeting (Siena) this
    week.  I have been unable to get to my mail except for a few
    minutes now and then, which is not enough time to answer technical
    questions.  Anyway, I am being kept busy here, I did a
    presentation at the CCP4 workshop (it went OK [Martin Noble was
    playing keyboard] but the audience was quiet) and man the CCP4
    booth at times when I haven't been going to the lectures.  

    <p> At the computing school I tried to do the tutorial set by
    George Sheldrick (which was to sort and merge a list of
    reflections) - using Clipper.  I haven't yet managed to get the
    right answers :-).

    <p> Several people have asked for side by side stereo.

    <p> I was told about the "Edit Backbone Torsions" crash bug (by
    Richard Bott, I think). Must fix.

    <p> A couple of people (including, I think, Jade Li) have asked
    for NCS copying of the NCS master chain coordinates to the others.
    So I have been working on that this morning.  I think that it's
    coming together.

    <p> Martin Walsh gave a presentation yesterday, which I liked -
    although Yvonne Jones did have trouble trying to get him to shut
    up... :-)

    <p>Made progress on the povray front with help from The Boy.

    <p> The food is good and I eat crispy pizzas.

    <p> In Siena, George encouraged me to add function to write a
    shelx ins file.  When I tried to show him that Coot could at least
    *read* an ins file, I failed!  Duh!  So I have fixed that (it was
    a problem generating the proper symmetry operators - they needed
    expansion by centering operators to initialize the space group and
    I was getting that wrong).  Residues with alternate conformations
    (using shelx occupancies) were getting marked as zero occupancy
    atoms.  That was clearly wrong and is fixed now.

    <p> Since the SPINE automation meeting (largely Molecular
    Replacement) it seems that chainsaw will be big in CCP4 MR
    automation system(s).  So we need to be able to handle the
    results.  So I have written a function fill-partial-residues
    (which I also call "de-chainsaw") which sprouts out sidechains
    where they had been hacked off by the chainsaw program.  Perhaps
    it should be a program available outside of Coot...

    <p> Kevin showed pictures of cats in his talk.  I thought that the
    cat that he called "ginger" was in fact, clearly green - and I
    make some comment about this after the presentation to a few people.
    They said that they thought the cat colour was indeed ginger (not
    green).  5 or 6 people that I spoke to also said they were ginger
    and Kevin said that he set the RGB values to be
    ginger. Hmmm... very strange.

    <hr>

    <p>Wed Aug 17 18:18:06 BST 2005
    <p> In the mean time (waiting for mgtree) I implemented reversing
    the direction of a chain fragment.  There is no gui to this yet
    and I don't even remember writing the documentation.  I will have
    to do that before the 0.0.34 release.  You pass it a residue that
    is in the fragment you want to reverse.  It finds the extents of
    the fragment (by residue number break/end (not distance)) and
    reverses it, leaving just the CAs.


    <p> (reverse-direction-of-fragment imol chainid resno)

    <p> Also I implemented the 180 degree torsion flip that Gideon
    Davies asked me for a while ago.  This *does* have a GUI.  I don't
    approve of the feature very much of course.  Rotamers are the way
    (well, generally speaking, they are, but I concede that he may
    have a point that it is the easiest way to fix some side chains
    (e.g. backwardsly build (by someone using some other program)
    valines and threonines).  It is slightly easier to use this to
    correct non-IUPAC nomenclature errors in e.g. Phes and Tyrs.

    <p> Also been thinking about what to say at the IUCr.  I think I
    might experiment using the new (and I think cool) code that
    downloads phased data from the EDS.  Pick a few deposited
    structures at random and validate them there and then.  We'll need
    internet connectivity for that of course.

    <p> Phil Evans tells me that the autobuilder for Mac OS X Tiger
    that we use here builds is broken and builds an ancient
    version. Groan....

    <p> We've connected Happy to Coot in a simplistic (but useful)
    way.

    <p> I checked the web logs.  4 people have read this (not all the
    way through, I imagine :-).  Hello Oxford, Cambridge, Santa Cruz
    and Otago.

    <p> OK, I am off to Gatwick for a flight to Florence tomorrow
    morning.  Nightmare with the (non-arriving) tickets today.  I am
    hot, grumpy, very tired and late.

    <p> This new PC has a Windows partition too.  I've been using it to
    play the odd game.  Battle for Middle Earth is what I am playing
    at the moment.  I like it - although it did get a bit too easy at
    the end.  I liked the campaign better than the skirmishes which is
    the other way round compared to starcraft.

    <p> I was given "Kuh Handel" for a present a while ago (this is a
    German card game) and we have only recently got around to playing
    it.  The first time we played I was mediocre and the second time
    (same people) I did terribly badly.  I was too conservative with
    my money and didn't put up enough of a fight to keep my horses.

    <p> Anyway, enough about games.

    <p> As I said, this PC has a Windows partition and I am putting
    together the bits to see if I can compile coot on Windows.  I am
    ploughing through the dependencies that Bernhard has done (and
    wrote up in our recent <a
    href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/newsletters/newsletter42/articles/newletter-july-2005-post-kevin1.pdf">Coot
    News CCP4 Newsletter article</a>).  So far I have installed
    clipper and can get the gtk-demo program to run. Next will be
    getting a gtk/GL program to compile which will involve some
    trickiness with windows GL libraries, I presume.

    <p>Today playing with post-buccaneer filtering - I'd made an
    oversight with symmetry filtering. I'd thought that my algorithm
    did full symmetry filtering, but it didn't.  I need to add a
    symmetry filtering step.  

    <p> Wretched mgtree still doesn't work. I'd updated mgtree utils
    from ccp4mg, but still doesn't work.  It is getting into a tangle
    over looped atom trees.  This is the feature that is delaying the
    0.0.34 release.  Stuart will have a look at it on Monday. I'd
    wanted 0.0.34 out before going to Italy.  Hmmm...

    <p> I've had a couple complaints today about how Baton Build
    works.  They were right.

    <p>I installed the latest NVidia drivers and indeed the text bug
    has gone away.

    <p>I connected Pirate to the HAPPy pipeline this morning.  I gave
    it a run with the GerE dataset in SAD mode.  It was reasonably
    quick but didn't give an interpretable map (you could see
    secondary structure with the eye of faith).  Well... I am not sure
    the parameters were optimal or that the starting phase set was up
    to much.

    <p>Cat owner brought round bottle of wine.
    <p>SGC people soon finished that off.

    <p>I rescued a cat today.

    <p>I noticed also that on this new computer I have the same text
    "bug" that I have seen for other people (If the label is at the
    screen centre it is fully bright. As you move the label away from
    the screen centre, towards the edge of the screen it gets dimmer,
    eventually becoming fully black. I begin to wonder if it is not a
    bug of the graphics driver as I had previously imagined.  Maybe if
    I install the NVidia driver it'll go away.

    <p>I've been playing with HAPPy on and off the last few days and
    submitting a bit of code here and there.  I am pleased how it is
    coming on.  We can run SHELXD now and get a nice table of results.

    <p>I thought I'd start a diary.  Perhaps someone would like to
    read it.  I'll check the web logs in a bit to see if more than one
    person a day (excluding me) is reading this. </p>

    <p> So Dan Rolfe has been here for the last few days and we've
    been bashing on code.

    <p> The first thing that we did was to rename PyChart to Happy
    (Heavy Atom Phasing in Python).

    <p>We've been having a SPINE meeting, so several people coming
    here and trying out Coot.  Found a few problems, not least of
    which is the difficulty in changing the direction of a Baton Build
    after you've finished it (basically, it can't be done - how
    annoying!).

    <p>Also merging of molecules gratuitously and irritatingly changes
    the chain ID. Bad.  Must make it optional.
