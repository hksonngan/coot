\hyperlink{struct_gtk_graph}{GtkGraph} is a simple to use widget for GTK+ V2.0 designed to allow easy presentation of scientific data. It has been designed with ease of use in mind and simple graphs can be produced with only a few function calls. Additional functions are provided to allow complete control of the format in which data traces are displayed, and scaling of the graph axes. A selection of graph annotations are also available to enhance display or draw attention to particular regions of the graph.

Currently three types of graph are supported by \hyperlink{struct_gtk_graph}{GtkGraph}:

XY plots -\/ where data pairs in the form (x co-\/ordinate, y co-\/ordinate) are plotted on a conventional Cartesian XY Graph

Polar plots -\/ where data pairs in the form (radial distance, angle) are plotted on a circular Polar Graph

Smith charts -\/ where complex electrical impedance or reflection coefficient data pairs are plotted on a Smith Chart\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
\hyperlink{struct_gtk_graph}{GtkGraph} uses the standard Gnu Build Tools therefore it should be sufficient to type open a terminal window and type ./configure. Once configure has done it's stuff then type make, and you should then have the static library built
