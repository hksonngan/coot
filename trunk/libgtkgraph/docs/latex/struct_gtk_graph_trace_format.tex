\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{struct_gtk_graph_trace_format}{GtkGraphTraceFormat} structure contains all of the formatting information for the formatting of individual traces. This is an opaque structure and its contents should not be written to directly. Instead please use the API functions such as \hyperlink{gtkgraph_8h_a0006dc30b139c49bfe454eee512c0754}{gtk\_\-graph\_\-trace\_\-format\_\-line()}, \hyperlink{gtkgraph_8h_a6d76b02b2e2db42af55cd3dd8a3df357}{gtk\_\-graph\_\-trace\_\-format\_\-marker()} or \hyperlink{gtkgraph_8h_ad81fd5d72e63d30a708d05707a657996}{gtk\_\-graph\_\-trace\_\-format\_\-title()} to modify the contents of this structure
