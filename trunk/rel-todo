---- 

   o Refining 55A SAH in 3NPN, it should not try to get dictionary up
     and downstrean neighbour if the residue's group is "monomer".

   o Add button that adds refmac hydrogens: 
     MAKE HOUT YES

   o in the mmcif to mtz reader, if there are 2 cells, use the first
     one, not the last one!  --- needs a clipper patch --- bleugh.

   o I want to be able to set the path for reduce and probe in my
     .coot.py file (not .coot)

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?

   o Jim Brannigan wants to see alt conf phi/psi angles in Residue Info.

   o in FLEV 2D, click on a bond -> 3d view centre to middle of those
     2 interacting atom

   o Top right exit should not write a state file.

       --no-state-file should not write a state file.

    But what about starting with interactive no to state-file reading?

    That also should write a state file. (user can use quick-save-as
    if they want)

   o in findwaters, allow the user to change the distance limits: 
     set_water_to_protein_distance_limits()

   o column types are not set in mtz file written by mmcif_sfs_to_mtz().

   o Consider change to configure.ac ::: 1

   o in FLEV the carboxylate of ligand Q31 doesn't make a H-bond to
     the mainchain.  Why not?

   o new molecule from atom selection (Copy Fragment) should generate
     a PDB file that has a CRYST1 card.

   o the question is why the chemical features on the
      carboxylate are asymmetric.  undelocalize()?

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?

     Hydrogens on the wrong way round like this means that the ligand
     fitting failed.  I corrected them by hand and the ligand fitting
     worked nicely (except a rotation round an acyl bond).

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?


   o Charge function in Lidia 

   o Update RDKit for Bill.

* Done.  Needs Bill to confirm

   o conditional SWIG - at compile time - for ENHANCED_LIGAND.

* Done?  Needs to be checked - e.g. by Garib.  Maybe I can do it?

   o hydrogenate the N terminus of tutorial-modern, what is happening to H3?

   o save_state_file() needs to write a python file when called from
     python (redefine save_save_file_py()).

   o Re-write ligand fitting tutorial using UJ6 from 4cgf (needs
     flexible fitting and consideration of chirality)

   o sharpen a Patterson. Kevin message

   o GLC pyranose 1-4 linked template.

   o PISA Interfaces surface colours are wrong. 

   o add surface and ball and stick ligand to tutorial.

   o hydrophobicity surface for next year (that's 2014, right?)

   o Reconsider descision to disallow reading of molecules with
     different residues but the same residue number and insertion code.

   o Don't display Save Molecule dialog if there are no molecules to save.
     Use the status bar.

   o Felix Frolow: (copy-residue-range-from-ncs-master-to-chains 0 "A" 1 500 (list "B" "C" "D" "E")) 
     but master chain is not A.

   o When (for example) with-ssmlib-prefix is specified, but the
     include/libs are not found, then we should exit configure with 
     an error

   o interesting ligand series examples: 4cie..s 4cj4..5 4cje..p

  * Wish: highlight bond/atom/angles of restraints selected in
    Restraints editor [DB via BL].

   o George S. Riding atom U problem

* Needs B factor from U checked.  And integrated into test/test-data.


   o bundle coot.probe and coot.reduce in the binaries

   o what's this: 

     Ooops fixed atom dialog has gone!

     (I had indeed dismissed the Fixed Atom Dialog)

     coot::make_molfile_molecule(const RDKit::ROMol &rdkm, int iconf)
     needs to (also) try to use _Name atom property.
 
* Fixed.  _TriposAtomName is what I wanted.

   o link for test data

* Done.


   o question for Eugene: 

      If I do:
  
      PCMMCIFLoop mmCIFLoop = new CMMCIFLoop; // 20100212
      rc = mmCIFData->AddLoop("_chem_comp", mmCIFLoop);

      then should I delete mmCIFLoop before it goes out of scope?

Done, code fixed. new is not needed.


   o Remove coords include/lib usage in geometry:
     chem_mods.cc:#include "coords/Cartesian.h"
     protein-geometry.cc:#include "coords/Cartesian.h"

     This might help the lib dependencies of the executables there.

* Done.

   * possibly fixed by adding CAtom * -> atom spec protection

   * possibly fixed by replacing with residue spec usage.


   o SWIG is defined when using SWIG and SWIGIMPORTED is used when
     imported via %import.  Change coot-utils/residue-and-atom-specs.hh 
     http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Preprocessor.html

* Done.

   o split out the cif parsing functions of protein-geometry.
     also link functions to another file?

* Done.

   o test that code block at 2040 in graphics-info-modelling.cc works as expected.

* It doesn't.  do_add_terminal_residue() does a check for a map first.



   o Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

* Can't see the problem.  Didn't try hard.

   o Tricky ligand problem: 4cje, use Residue -> 2D and prodrg to
     generate restraints.  After normal "Apply" (and import) the
     resulting ligand has hydrogens on the wrong way round.  Why
     didn't the refinment fix this?  What is the pathology?

* How much do I care really?  PRODRG is practically dead now.


     Hydrogens on the wrong way round like this (i.e. the wrong side
     of the chiral centre) means that the subsequent ligand
     fitting failed.  I corrected them by hand and the ligand fitting
     worked nicely (except a rotation round an acyl bond).

     I want to see mark-up of restraints violation (not mogul).  I hope that the
     incorrect orientation of the isobutyl should then be apparent.

* It is, very clearly.

     Also give me a table of restraints violation for a given residue,
     bond and angles at least (worse than xx z?).

* Done.  Useful.

   o To explain the update to helix fitting in EM maps, we need to
     find the distribution of (n rms) density of atom in refined maps.  
     Maybe there is a relationship to resolution.  Try a few 100 structures. 

Not now.

   o Remove -lXmu and see what happens.

* Punt.

   o patch dictionary for chiral link restraint for NAG-ASN

* Punt.

   o Quick notebook: (what was changed on this residue? on previous rounds?)

* Punt.

   o drag and drop SMILES strings into lidia

* Punt.

   o render the SMILES string in this file

* Punt

   o Lidia: Need atom label CH3 (or CH2) at end of bonds

* Punt

   o validate real metals for coordination (instead of only waters)?

* Punt http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24356774

   o What about placement of RNA rotamers?

* Punt. Tricky.

   o extend lidia to represent carbohydrates. Low priority. Should be
     done in RDKit, I think (Haworth projections)

* Punt.

   o Repeat B-form DNA in 10.5 bp, not 11.

* Punt.


   o Bernie notes:

   1.) when downloading a non existing (sf) cif file I get clipper fatal
   crash. I guess this should be protected. Not sure but this may be a
   clipper issue (havent investigated further for now)


   Reading cif file: coot-download/1ASD.cif
   CIFfile: set_cell_symm_reso_by_cif: Could not read:
   coot-download/1ASD.cif dirty
     mmCIF file?
   terminate called after throwing an instance of 'clipper::Message_fatal'

* Old clipper, it seems.


   2.) scheme script (now) does not download sf but coordinate cif (feature?)

* Fixed.

   3.) When using an actual cif (3sdf) I get the following (clipper) error.
   Again maybe a clipper thingy (and not much further investigated - hence
   email to you):

   Reading cif file: coot-download/3sdf.cif

   Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
   0x00a26e34 in _fu17232___ZNSs4_Rep20_S_empty_rep_storageE ()
        at cif_data_io.cpp:346

  * this all looks like use of the wrong library.  I tried these files
    and it works as expected for me.

  * I agree. :)

   o Deal with LEU nomenclature error problem on list recently (Dirk K.).

* Punt.

   o Fix nomenclature error hydrogens on PHE and TYR - others also?   

* Done - LEUs and VALs need doing also.

   o in FLEV, find pi-pi stacking interactions, if needed use an
     RDKit molecule to find aromatic systems in the ligand.

* Done. At last.  Cool.

   o Why doesn't the key get written to the pdf file in LIDIA?

* Done.
