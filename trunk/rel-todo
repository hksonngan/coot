   34 dev points -> March 18th

   o Use libcurl to get URLs.  It does proxies.  Stop using nethttp.
     ::: 3

   o Keating code :: 2

   o Check waters by difference map fails on Misty's waters.  Data on
     stick.   ::: 3

   o search for, download, update binary.  Needs libcurl ::: 4

   o Quicksave: save all molecules (if they need saving) to default
     names and save state. ::: 1

   o Need a keybinding for "regularize these 3 residues". ::: 0.5

   o OXT in refinement (e.g. monomer-BCS.pdb) fails to reach
     convergence. ::: 3

   o Baton-build mode needs to work better when starting with no
     skeleton.   ::: 1

   o Can baton mode work when the skeleton runs out? ::: 3

   o Move-aside (like other dialog) the edit-chi angles dialog ::: 1

   o Fix the built-in help.  ::: 1

   o Find Waters: why does it miss some nice densities sometimes?  ::: 4

   o HK: I want a function to set the refinement weight for me, 
     i.e.  it should do a triple refine and look at the chi squareds.
     Keep doing that with different weights until we get to 1.0.  ::: 2

   o Make python coot work on CentOS 4.  It does?  Needs testing.  ::: 2

   o Hydrogens should have thinner bonds.  (Not half bonds - all grey
     - more like molprobity/KING) ::: 2

   o I am looking at a symmetry-related part of the molecule. Take me
     to the main molecule (try unapplying symmetry to get there). 
     ::: 2
