    Points 40: April 4th

    o SBase GUI ::: 3

    o Make RSR interuptable ::: 2

    o chemical component library interface ::: 4

    o white background with ball and stick models. ::: 4

    o get reverse NCS skip working ::: 2

    o PIR alignment: on pressing the insertion button, go to the
      nearest residue to the gap. [Joel Bard] ::: 1 

    o coordination number of waters validataion check ::: 5

    o PISA interfaces via XML  ::: 5

    o trapped out of range phi/psi access: 1040 A ich: 0 ires: 895
      phi_psi_sets[ich].phi_psi.size(): 839
      Which is when the rama plot stops working  ::: 1

    o does rotate/translate zone (on a water) update symmetry? [Ezra
      Peisach] ::: 1

    o roll up/collapse addition representation in Display manager when
      they are not displayed ::: 2

    o Felix F SHELXL symmetry problem.

    o alt confs cause problems in geometry graph [JED]

    o If low res limit is not set in the Expert options (reading mtz)
      then neither limit is used [Randy Read]

------


    o Fix rename-residue to work on just one chain ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o Move molecule here should have a check-button for "allow big
      molecules to move" ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o H-bond-only, bump-only environment distances.  ::: 1

* Done.

    o Give a dialog of the alignment done in align&mutate ::: 1

* Done.

    o SBase internal interface ::: 3

* Done.

    o Move check water by difference map into water validation dialog 
      check_waters_by_difference_map_by_widget(GtkWidget *dialog) need to go
      Also wrapped_create_check_waters_diff_map_dialog()
      ::: 3

* Done.

    o sort chains with an mmdb function ::: 4

* Done.

    o 1a34: look at the waters - they have hydrogens.  Need to change
      the bonding system.  ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o check the atoms of the residues to be refined against the
      dictionary. JED ::: 4

* Done.
