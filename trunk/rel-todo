   o Ctrl-Arrow keys on a residue should move just the given alt conf
     atom set.

   o draw_generic_text() should have a user-setable font size.

   o Does Acedrg get A3D correct?  (libcheck does not)  A3D in 4ND2

   o Region morph.  I have control over the central residue and the
     neighbours have RTops relative to this (do it by atom?)

----

   o CSHL:

       * key-binding for rock (Ctrl-R?)

       * Scaling of density fit analysis with very fine grid

       * Return should accept in Rotamer mode
    
       * Anti-submarine Unmodelled blobs -> no blobs

       * Try Ramachandran restraints with hydrogen atoms, look at
         clash score, low resolution maps

   o when back home, check that we can update from glade-2
     coot-gtk2.glade with the changed post-gtk2-glade.sh

   o with-enhanced-ligand tools 
 
   o in CA + Ligands mode with Hydrogen atoms off: the hydrogen atoms
     are still displayed on the ligand: 

      -- Alex Wlodawer

   o when you move a licorice model it goes ball-and-stick. Fix.

      -- JED

   o compile rdkit with inchi support. Test. Write to restriants. 

   o compile a coot without python

   o Torsion fit this residue pyrogen-I79.pdb in 3rvb

   o Check this ligand

   o Try glyco tree builder 528 on 4lxr. 

   o build NAG-NAG on 3bt1 on 172U ASN.

* Nasty - and interesting.

   o a nice function - for ligand presentation (and rendering) is to
     find the screen centre and view quaternion that orients the ligand
     nicely. Puntable.

   o reading a pdbfile that is a directory causes mmdb2 to hang?

   o fix the alerts on importing mol/residue -> 2d

* Done

   o jiggle fit leaves behind atoms that have zero occupancy? 
     e.g. jiggle-fit the acedrg output of Acedrg on I79.cif in 3rvb

* Done.

   o make check should run cleanly. Add it to build-for-release.

* Done

   o compile a coot without guile-gtk

* Done.

   o how do I turn off generalization in mogul?

     CONFIG SEARCH ALL GENERALISATION OFF
   
* Done in gui-mogul.scm


   o Coot crashes on using the About dialog

* Can't reproduce

   Mark Saper on a Mac (no guile-gtk):

1. Upon exiting Coot I receive these lines in the terminal output.  The window asking about clearing backups is never shown.

    ...
    (coot-checked-exit 0)
    (clear-backups-maybe)
    ((safe_scheme_command) Error in proc: key:  unbound-variable  args:  (#f Unbound variable: ~S (gtk-window-new) #f))
    WARNING:: (clear-backups-maybe) returns object: #<unspecified>
    (stereo-mode-state)
    (stereo-mode-state)
    (save-state)

   o I79 short bonds to H18,H19 from N3

* Done

   o dictionary bonds:  I79 Do we have these ones:

   o make a minimol of oliver-clarke test.  Does it get all the chains?

* Done.


   o Not running test (the default?) - gives test failure message?  It
     shouldn't.

* Done.

   o remove all references to MMDB_MAJOR_VERSION

* Done.


   o add-terminal-residue-by-phi-psi should allow me to add to a
     singleton (add to the C-terminus)

* Done.

   o make drag elasticity as user-settable parameter - Oliver Clarke.

* Done.


   o The dialogs that you get after Validate -> Check/Delete waters
     should be transients.

* Done.

   o Fix the python-only template keybindings

* Done.

   o Lothar Esser:

         Fix the map selector: (Home project)
  
     Example: In phenix I use anomalous_flag= None (or True ) which
     triggers the calculation of anomalous map coefficients. So you
     have ANOM and PANOM columns.  I open the mtz file (here called
     current.mtz) and select ANOM and PANOM and set the resolution to
     a lower value: In display manager I get:

     3 current.mtz ANOM PANOM 18.00 5.00    <-- good and short.

     In "Map" to be selected I get this:
     3 /home/dxlab/esser/Project/xxx/xxxx/Crystals/Y104a/139B_A41/Refine/current.mtz /crystal/Fourier-map-coefficients/ANOM /crystal/Fourier-map-coefficients/PANOM 18.00 5.00

     This seems a bit long. For me, the display manager entry would suffice.

* Done.
