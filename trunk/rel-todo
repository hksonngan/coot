   o with enhanced-ligand, do you get a sane code-path if you do 
     File -> SMILES?

   o Ligand Check

   o Uncrunch

   o Oliver Clarke Rigid Body bug

   o read in libg restraints, delete them, read in filtered
     restraints.  Display should update properly.


------

   o compile rdkit with inchi support. Test. Write to restriants. 
Punt

   o Ctrl-Arrow keys on a residue should move just the given alt conf
     atom set.
Punt

   o Region morph.  I have control over the central residue and the
     neighbours have RTops relative to this (do it by atom?)
Punt.

   o EL Coot should use pyrogen if mogul is available.

* Done.

   o when you move a licorice model it goes ball-and-stick. Fix.

      -- JED

* Done.

   o when back home, check that we can update from glade-2
     coot-gtk2.glade with the changed post-gtk2-glade.sh

 * Done.

   o Does PISA interface work? 6.4, 6.5?

* It does now

   o missing cis-pep - Evzen Boura 

* Done.  Very esoteric.

   o is coot-crash-catcher doing the right thing when the process is
     killed/dies?

* No.  Fixed nown

   o Put Export map and map fragment under File.
            -- Andrea T

   o Add "What's this?" to the function that updates the thumbnail
     - Dave Brown.

* Done.

   o Boaz S.: crash catcher in binary-Linux-x86_64-rhel-6-python-gtk2  5619

* Done.

   o Add a user function to return mean, median, min, max, skew, kurtosis
     and optionally histogram of map density values.
      --- Alejandro Virrueta

* Done.

   o Get monomer -> get PDBe ligand (and run dictionary generator?)
     or on failure,  get a useful error meesage/text dialog

* Done.

   o Validate menu checking for probe/reduce. Do it only once.

* Done.

   o a nice function - for ligand presentation (and rendering) is to
     find the screen centre and view quaternion that orients the ligand
     nicely. Puntable.

* Done.

   o Fix the NCS master chain problem - Airlie McCoy

* Done.

   o Export the dots from HOLE.

* Done.

   o Add the residue where a CIS peptide has been introduced.
     - Dave Brown

* Done.

   o Change the drag so that I can drag a loop in a 3A data.

* Done.

   o I noticed when adjusting the 'bond colours' using the slider in
     'Edit/Bond Colours...' when an molecule (>1 chain) is 'coloured
     by chain') with activated check mark 'Change colours for Carbons
     only' only the colours of the first chain (chain A) can be
     adjusted, the remaining chain(s) remain unchanged. In contrast,
     this is not observed when 'Change colours for Carbons only' is
     not ticked. I can't believe this is intentional?
        - Christoph Parthier

* "Feature", not a bug.

   o I've noticed that disulfide bonds are not drawn when color by
     chain is activated in the Display Manager window. 
	- Donald Damian

* Done.

   o in Jones' Rainbow hetgroups should be yellow (or grey?)

* Done.

   o in Jones' Rainbow for 2hvs, why can't I pick D125? (because it
     doesn't have a P)

* Punt.

   o Own font colour changes on using Preferences

* Done.


   o Does Acedrg get A3D correct?  (libcheck does not)  A3D in 4ND2

* Looks fine to me

   o An O in 0BU thumbnail falls off the screen (4mtz)

* Done.

   o in CA + Ligands mode with Hydrogen atoms off: the hydrogen atoms
     are still displayed on the ligand: 
      -- Alex Wlodawer

* Done.

       * Return should accept in Rotamer mode
    
* Too hard for too trivial a gain. (rotamer_dialog needs to be used
  cleanly - i.e. clear the pointer when the dialog is destroyed)


       * Try Ramachandran restraints with hydrogen atoms, look at
         clash score, low resolution maps

* Punt
