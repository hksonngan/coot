  o in 3s4w the Bonding in CA mode is wrong at residue 411.   ::: 1

  o CCP4-based integrated path for FLEV ::: 6

  o Make ligands work ::: 20

  o Add nucleotide to 3' end - Sabine Schneider.  Check Kevin's fix -
    needs test ::: 1

  o Fix lighting for solid env distances ::: 1

  o Fix lighting for solid generic objects ::: 1

  o Fix splash screen per SS message.  Fix symmetry file names too ::: 2

  o Fix crash, Jim Branigan message ::: 4

  o Related to above: Fix crash-catcher script to work with pythonized coot ::: 2

  o consider better analysis of disulfides, bonding and refinement.
    Consider iron-sulfur clusters.  ::: 3

  o "Mutate DA to DT and C7 is missing" - Sabine Schneider ::: 1

* Done

  o Fix TER records on mutating a base [James Parker] ::: 2

* Done.

  o DNA in sequence view [Miguel Ortiz Lombardia] ::: 1

* Done

  o Other DNA problem: mutation/adding Ts to DNA? ::: 2

* Not as far as I can see - get Miguel to use the new version. Done.

  o Recent structures browser (scheme version) ::: 8

* Done.

  o Load ASN from SBASE using Lidia menu.  Molecule has thick bonds to
    hydrogens. ::: 0.5

* Fixed now that SBASE residues are hetgroups, I think.

  o Fix renumbering problem [John Berrisford] ::: 2

* Done.

  o consider adding displayed geometry -> Distances to session file. ::: 1

* Done.

  o Is PISA in 6.2 up to date enough to enable the menu in Coot? ::: 0.5

* Yes.

  o Don't drag last-placed bond after button-up in lbg ::: 0

* Nothing to do.  It's fixed already, it seems.

  o Picking atoms in Jones mode needs to pick only CAs. ::: 0.5

* Done.  Trivially set pick mode correctly for the display mode in atom_pick().

  o need tlc->name function and use it in add solvent molecules ::: 0.5

* Done
