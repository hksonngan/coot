   o ligand from 3b6a has lost an OH in the thumbnail.
     Also, carboxylates drawn wrongly.  ::: 0.5

* Done.
   
   o Phil: I want bond orders in colour-by-chain mode.

     This is problematic because thinning depends on colour index -
     independent of where the bonds come from - either bonds to
     hydrogen or CA bonds.  ::: 0.5

* forget thinning.  Hacked it in for now - colours are a bit strange.

Done.

   o Get from PDBe... fails in refmac for 4eh5 (pressing the button on
     the recent structures gui) with 

 Refmac_5.7.0029:  Check input coordinates
 Refmac_5.7.0029:  New ligand has been encountered. Stopping now
 
   message.

     Doing it from the entry seems to do nothing.  

    ::: 0.5

* Seems OK to me...

   o get minimal description for ligand from pdb/rcsb ::: 0.2

* Done.

   o B-factor sharpening correction, Chang Liu ::: 0.5
 
* Done.

   o 3tos fails to offset correctly in sequence view.
     Punt?  ::: 1

* Done.  Close enough - residues go beyond magic number (canvas max size).
