---- 

   o Fix:
     coords/mmdb-extras.h:112: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions

   o remove graphics_info_t from molecule_class_info_t::update_symmetry().

   o Tim G: AFIX problems.

   o can you make the double-line filter in contouring faster: using
     an index hash? (use long long) Write a test - scroll up and down
     a 20A sphere, say.

   o does drag and drop urls work? I mean, say from my tutorial web page?

   o if you have a wedge bond in lbg, try to make it a single bond.

   o why does 201 and 202 disconnect in chain-N-with-FUC-reordered-with-link.pdb?

   o test water_to_protein_distance_limits() use in find-waters

   o I think that there was a bug in coot::dict_plane_restraint_t::matches_names()
     Have a second look.  Test.

   o set_monomer_restraints() for planes needs some thought about how
     to handle individual atom esds.

   o get flavin.mol - and write a python script to show the bond
     properties (including aromaticity of bonds).  C10-C4X should be
     aromatic, shouldn't it?

   o a nice function - for ligand presentation (and rendering) is to
     find the screen centre and view quaternion that orients the ligand
     nicely.

   o Look at the colours against a light background.  Is the
     "against_a_dark_backround?" code working correctly?

   o PDB_REDO should load the difference map too.

   o in findwaters, allow the user to change the distance limits: 
     set_water_to_protein_distance_limits()

   o Fix the button labels in Close molecule dialogs.

* Done? Check.  The menu item should say "Delete molecule/map" not "Close..." 

   o fit_to_map_by_random_jiggle should return a valid value.

   o ALPHA2-3 link refinement is broken?

   o go to atom Atom list for residue with insertion codes: e.g. H 60 in 3biu.

   o FUC - alpha1-2 - b- galact beta-1-4 NAG

                          beta-1-3 NAG


   o We need FUC decorations and GAL (beta galactose) decorations

*Done.  Needs a test.

   o Try glyco tree builder 528 on 4lxr. 


   o change the front-page icons on the glade file.

   o Promote to the gui Sloop (db loop)

   o Ming Sun:

* Fixed - needs a test.

   o chiral centre inverter in C++  

   o why is one of the N+ in the nitros chiral in the thumbnail of 128?

   o modified residue (e.g. oxidised Cys).  Mutate it back to CYS.
     It's still HETATMs.

   o convert the residue too in match_residue_and_dictionary().  It should have a test :-)

* It actually does.  Still needs a test though.

   o Pavel message: Map D to H so that you can refine proteins vs neutron data.

   o Oliver Clark HOLE radius bug

   o build NH4 in lbg.  Is the N charged in the resulting mol file?

   o 4gos is great for carbohydrate building (Andre L. example).  Also
     the BMA fails to build in corectly.  It's a ligand LSQ fit
     problem, I think. When this works, put it in the GUI.

   o check that FE-CYS link "just works" in sphere refine.

    on mogul validation of MFX the 3rd time (after deleting hydrogens)

       (why does the residue pointer recover in 3?)

   o in FLEV 2D, click on a bond -> 3d view centre to middle of those
     2 interacting atom

   o I want to be able to set the path for reduce and probe in my
     .coot.py file (not .coot)

   o is 4CJN published yet?

   o Top right exit should not write a state file.

       --no-state-file should not write a state file.

    But what about starting with interactive no to state-file reading?

    That also should write a state file. (user can use quick-save-as
    if they want)

* Improved now?  Needs checking.

   o fit_to_map_by_random_jiggle should return a valid value.

   o The test-mogl.scm script needs to be updated. Do this at work.

   o chiral centre inverter in C++. Needs a gui presence.
  
   o imol_map should not be passed to molecule_class_info_t::auto_fit_best_rotamer().

   o auto-open mtz should also open xxx.F_phi.F and xxx.F_phi.phi

   o Refining 55A SAH in 3NPN, it should not try to get dictionary up
     and downstrean neighbour if the residue's group is "monomer".

   o in the mmcif to mtz reader, if there are 2 cells, use the first
     one, not the last one!  --- needs a clipper patch --- bleugh.

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?

   o Jim Brannigan wants to see alt conf phi/psi angles in Residue Info.

   o column types are not set in mtz file written by mmcif_sfs_to_mtz().

   o Consider change to configure.ac ::: 1

   o in FLEV the carboxylate of ligand Q31 doesn't make a H-bond to
     the mainchain.  Why not?

   o new molecule from atom selection (Copy Fragment) should generate
     a PDB file that has a CRYST1 card.

   o the question is why the chemical features on the
      carboxylate are asymmetric.  undelocalize()?

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?

     Hydrogens on the wrong way round like this means that the ligand
     fitting failed.  I corrected them by hand and the ligand fitting
     worked nicely (except a rotation round an acyl bond).

   o Lots of testing of add other solvent molecules, jiggle-fit, in
     low-resolution maps, perhaps?

   o Charge function in Lidia 

   o conditional SWIG - at compile time - for ENHANCED_LIGAND.

* Done?  Needs to be checked - e.g. by Garib.  Maybe I can do it?

   o hydrogenate the N terminus of tutorial-modern, what is happening to H3?

   o save_state_file() needs to write a python file when called from
     python (redefine save_save_file_py()).

   o Re-write ligand fitting tutorial using UJ6 from 4cgf (needs
     flexible fitting and consideration of chirality)

   o sharpen a Patterson. Kevin message

   o GLC pyranose 1-4 linked template.

   o PISA Interfaces surface colours are wrong. 

   o add surface and ball and stick ligand to tutorial.

   o hydrophobicity surface for next year (that's 2014, right?)

   o Reconsider descision to disallow reading of molecules with
     different residues but the same residue number and insertion code.

   o Don't display Save Molecule dialog if there are no molecules to save.
     Use the status bar.

   o Felix Frolow: (copy-residue-range-from-ncs-master-to-chains 0 "A" 1 500 (list "B" "C" "D" "E")) 
     but master chain is not A.

   o When (for example) with-ssmlib-prefix is specified, but the
     include/libs are not found, then we should exit configure with 
     an error

   o interesting ligand series examples: 4cie..s 4cj4..5 4cje..p

     2xx series, e.g. 2xx7, 2xx8, 2xxh, 2xxi, 2xxj

  * Wish: highlight bond/atom/angles of restraints selected in
    Restraints editor [DB via BL].

   o George S. Riding atom U problem

* Needs B factor from U checked.  And integrated into test/test-data.


   o bundle coot.probe and coot.reduce in the binaries

   o what's this: 

     Ooops fixed atom dialog has gone!

     (I had indeed dismissed the Fixed Atom Dialog)

-----

   o with --no-graphics, don't try to start coot crash catcher
 
* Done.

   o look at 3owu for symmetry expansion (symmetry lies over main
     molecule?)

* No, that's fine (maybe wrong code?)

   o guile without guile-gui  (#f Unbound variable: ~S (place-strand-here-gui) #f))

* Fixed.

   o libtool usage goo-canvas check.

* Fixed.

   o Fix CA mode with MSEs

* Done.

   o Strange canvas scrolling with big RNA 

* added a hack.

   o sequence assignment for placement of RNA.

* Done.

   o sort out the FAQ (Bernie message)

* Done.

   o need a test to see if hydrogens are properly swapped on a
     nomenclature change on a TYR.

* Done.

   o hydrogens are corrected also on nomenclature correction?

* Done.

   o Ligand fitting is broken.  Why does it work with 
     (set-find-ligand-multi-solutions-per-cluster 0.88 0.88)

* Fixed.  Bug in extents code.

   o recent structure browser data download.

* Fixed.

   o mtz-file-name->colummn-labels

* Done.

   o PDB-redo into coot File menu.

* Done.

   o get drug: suvorexant - what's going wrong?

* Varibility in drugbox formatting.

   o drag and drop - same reason.

* PubChem added.

   o Does rubber-banding in sphere-refine mode move the fixed environment residues?
   o Are active residues bumping off environment residues in sphere-refine mode?
	
* Fixed. 

   o 1r9f fails to load from PDBe.

* "H 3 2" fixed in (my patched) clipper.

  o Markus Rudolf: atom names are not preserved on reading mol2 files.
 
     rdkit-interface.cc: lig_build::molfile_molecule_t
     coot::make_molfile_molecule(const RDKit::ROMol &rdkm, int iconf)
     needs to (also) try to use _Name atom property.
 
* Fixed.  _TriposAtomName is what I wanted.

   o link for test data

* Done.


   o question for Eugene: 

      If I do:
  
      PCMMCIFLoop mmCIFLoop = new CMMCIFLoop; // 20100212
      rc = mmCIFData->AddLoop("_chem_comp", mmCIFLoop);

      then should I delete mmCIFLoop before it goes out of scope?

Done, code fixed. new is not needed.


   o Remove coords include/lib usage in geometry:
     chem_mods.cc:#include "coords/Cartesian.h"
     protein-geometry.cc:#include "coords/Cartesian.h"

     This might help the lib dependencies of the executables there.

* Done.

   * possibly fixed by replacing with residue spec usage.


   o SWIG is defined when using SWIG and SWIGIMPORTED is used when

   o split out the cif parsing functions of protein-geometry.
     also link functions to another file?

     resulting ligand has hydrogens on the wrong way round.  Why
     didn't the refinment fix this?  What is the pathology?

* How much do I care really?  PRODRG is practically dead now.


     Hydrogens on the wrong way round like this (i.e. the wrong side
     of the chiral centre) means that the subsequent ligand
     fitting failed.  I corrected them by hand and the ligand fitting
     worked nicely (except a rotation round an acyl bond).

     I want to see mark-up of restraints violation (not mogul).  I hope that the
     incorrect orientation of the isobutyl should then be apparent.

* It is, very clearly.

     Also give me a table of restraints violation for a given residue,
     bond and angles at least (worse than xx z?).

* Done.  Useful.

   o To explain the update to helix fitting in EM maps, we need to
     find the distribution of (n rms) density of atom in refined maps.  
     Maybe there is a relationship to resolution.  Try a few 100 structures. 

Not now.

   o Remove -lXmu and see what happens.

* Punt.

   o patch dictionary for chiral link restraint for NAG-ASN

* Punt.

   o Quick notebook: (what was changed on this residue? on previous rounds?)

* Punt.


   o render the SMILES string in this file

* Punt

   o Lidia: Need atom label CH3 (or CH2) at end of bonds

* Punt

   o validate real metals for coordination (instead of only waters)?

* Punt http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24356774

   o What about placement of RNA rotamers?

* Punt. Tricky.

   o extend lidia to represent carbohydrates. Low priority. Should be
     done in RDKit, I think (Haworth projections)

* Punt.

   o Repeat B-form DNA in 10.5 bp, not 11.

* Punt.


   o Bernie notes:

   1.) when downloading a non existing (sf) cif file I get clipper fatal
   crash. I guess this should be protected. Not sure but this may be a
   clipper issue (havent investigated further for now)


   Reading cif file: coot-download/1ASD.cif
   CIFfile: set_cell_symm_reso_by_cif: Could not read:
   coot-download/1ASD.cif dirty
     mmCIF file?
   terminate called after throwing an instance of 'clipper::Message_fatal'

* Old clipper, it seems.


   2.) scheme script (now) does not download sf but coordinate cif (feature?)

* Fixed.

   3.) When using an actual cif (3sdf) I get the following (clipper) error.
   Again maybe a clipper thingy (and not much further investigated - hence
   email to you):

   Reading cif file: coot-download/3sdf.cif

   Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
   0x00a26e34 in _fu17232___ZNSs4_Rep20_S_empty_rep_storageE ()
        at cif_data_io.cpp:346

  * this all looks like use of the wrong library.  I tried these files
    and it works as expected for me.

  * I agree. :)

   o Deal with LEU nomenclature error problem on list recently (Dirk K.).

* Punt.

   o Fix nomenclature error hydrogens on PHE and TYR - others also?   

* Done - LEUs and VALs need doing also.

   o in FLEV, find pi-pi stacking interactions, if needed use an
     RDKit molecule to find aromatic systems in the ligand.

* Done. At last.  Cool.

   o Why doesn't the key get written to the pdf file in LIDIA?

* Done.

   o invert chiral centre 

 * Done.

   o Difference maps peaks dialog

* Done.

   o auto open mtz opens diff map strangely.

* Done.

   o Oliver Smart: invert chiral centre on glycerol 3 phosphate

* Done.

   o Update RDKit for Bill.

* Done.  

   o OS: when map sharpening is selected but no map has been set, coot
     crashes with the following segfault:

     DEBUG:: imol from fill_option_menu_with_map_options() -1
     /usr/local/bin/coot: line 10: 15221 Segmentation fault: 11  /Library/Coot/bin/coot-real "$@"

* Fixed when SRS is not used.   


   o When the spacegroup is P1 or 0, and the cell has 90 degrees, the
     calculation of the sigma should ignore "zero" values.

* Done.

   o Add button that adds refmac hydrogens: 
     MAKE HOUT YES

* Done.


   o where does the extra hydrogen come when making a pyrogen
     dictionary for MFX?

   o why is there an H1 on the N01 in N01 in the pyrogen cif dictionary?

* From "AllChem.AddHs()". Fixed.

 
   o remove atom name quotes from dictionary.

* Done.

   o nuclsq for base pair and stacking restraints.

* Not discussed in the documentation.

   o latest python is 2.7.6 now?

* Yes. Added to builder.

   o highly coordinates waters should check metal atoms too.
     water-coordination.cc: How do you select metals? Check the element? 
     MG|CA|K|NA|LI|RB|BE|BA|FR|CS|SR

* Done.

   o carboylates in FLEV.  Why OH, not O- (as it is in the thumbnail?)

* Done - because widgeted_molecule_t constructor from a lig_build::molfile_molecule_t
  didn't set the atom formal charge.

   o drag and drop SMILES strings into lidia

* Nope.  Cut and paste would be better.  And paste into SMILES entry
  (where we can edit it) - Pressing return does "Apply this SMILES"

  The problem is that the SMILES string is written to the status bar.
  Do we want another bar that has the SMILES string in it? And move
  the status bar down?

   o As one sketches a molecule in lbg, coot should search (with SRS)
     the current dictionary and let you know if the thing that you are
     sketching is in the dictionary (or maybe there should be a button
     to check (which will be easier)).

* Punt 

   o graphs should auto-determine if they have integer values for the
     y-values and if so, don't put ticks and labels in non-integer
     positions.

* Done.

   o GPCR ligand analysis.  

Punt.

   o Add pdb_validate() when getting a structure

   o close button on pdb_validate()

* Done.

   o Auto-open XXX.F_phi.F and XXX.F_phi.phi

* Done


   o remove this debugging

=== atoms_match_dictionary() with these residue atom names ======= 
0  : O2A: and ele  O
1  : PA : and ele  P
2  : O1A: and ele  O
3  : O3A: and ele  O
4  : PB : and ele  P
5  : O1B: and ele  O
6  : O2B: and ele  O

* Done.

   o Steven Sheriff:

     I noticed the following about symmetry labeled atoms:

     The new style could use one more piece of punctuation, e.g. CA/36
     THR/CX,Y,Z + (0 0 -1) & {0 0 0} would be more readable with some
     sort of punctuation (a space, a comma, a semi-colon, a colon)
     between the atom label and the symmetry label, e.g. CA/36 THR/C
     X,Y,Z + (0 0 -1) & {0 0 0}

* Done.

   o lidia_LDFLAGS = -Wl,--export-dynamic, what is -module flag and look up export_dynamic_flag_spec

* Done - the second part anyway.


   o why does 201 and 202 disconnect in chain-N-with-FUC-reordered-with-link.pdb?

     - Because the PDB file is wrong (for a BETA1-3 link) the linking
       atom should be on "residue-1" not "residue-2" as it is here.
