  o Make sure ligands work with prodrg ::: 6

  o Does RCrane work? ::: 0.5

  o Accept/Reject dialog is not opening where I left it on previous
    usage (not previous session, even!) ::: 1

  o Fix splash screen per SS message.  ::: 0.5

  o SS: Fix symmetry file names ::: 2

  o CCP4-based integrated path for FLEV ::: 6

  o Fix lighting for solid env distances ::: 1

  o Fix lighting for solid generic objects ::: 1

  o consider better analysis of disulfides, bonding and refinement.
    Consider iron-sulfur clusters.  ::: 3

  o try to make a difference map by making an average map with scale
    -1 for the second map.  Does it work? ::: 1

  o Downloading pdbe data needs to be silent (in scheme) in case the
    user has the coot scheme scripting window open (threading issues).

  o download 3s9q from pdbe - crashes (not crash when files cached)  :: 2

  o Unusual Rotamers on 3amy ::: 2

  o check that probe works ::: 1

  o Fix crash, Jim Branigan message ::: 4

  o Related to above: Fix crash-catcher script to work with pythonized
    coot ::: 2

  o place atom at pointer. Use tutorial data from clean.  Does the
    water go into the correct molecule? (or does it go into Pointer
    Atoms molecule?) ::: 1

  o problems bonding problem-x.pdb (marmoset) - no dictionary,
    cyclobutane. ::: 1

------

  o "Mutate DA to DT and C7 is missing" - Sabine Schneider ::: 1

* Done

  o Fix TER records on mutating a base [James Parker] ::: 2

* Done.

  o DNA in sequence view [Miguel Ortiz Lombardia] ::: 1

* Done

  o Other DNA problem: mutation/adding Ts to DNA? ::: 2

* Not as far as I can see - get Miguel to use the new version. Done.

  o Recent structures browser (scheme version) ::: 8

* Done.

  o Load ASN from SBASE using Lidia menu.  Molecule has thick bonds to
    hydrogens. ::: 0.5

* Fixed now that SBASE residues are hetgroups, I think.

  o Fix renumbering problem [John Berrisford] ::: 2

* Done.

  o consider adding displayed geometry -> Distances to session file. ::: 1

* Done.

  o Is PISA in 6.2 up to date enough to enable the menu in Coot? ::: 0.5

* Yes.

  o Don't drag last-placed bond after button-up in lbg ::: 0

* Nothing to do.  It's fixed already, it seems.

  o Picking atoms in Jones mode needs to pick only CAs. ::: 0.5

* Done.  Trivially set pick mode correctly for the display mode in atom_pick().

  o need tlc->name function and use it in add solvent molecules ::: 0.5

* Done


  o Add nucleotide to 3' end - Sabine Schneider.  Check Kevin's fix -
    needs test ::: 1

* Seems good.

  o display a molecule, activate distance, now try to pick atoms in space 
    -> (undisplayed) symm atoms get picked!  Wrong  ::: 0.5

* Done - add check that symmetry is displayed.

  o in 3s4w the Bonding in CA mode is wrong at residue 411.   ::: 1

* Fixed.

  o get rid of this debugging:

* Done.

  o "Save coordinates file name selector" window should be a transient
    (Andrew Sharff).  

* It is, AFAICS.  Hmmm!

  o sphere refine 1284 A of 3zr5 -> fails to find link bonds and
    GSL_NOPROG.  (Try NAGs in other proteins, seems this problem is not
    unique to this structure? (but not everything! Hmm!))  Try 3sq6
    first, that has just this message:

    WARNING:: dictionary vs model problem? We didn't find the bonded
    linking atoms : C1 : : ND2:
 
    and refines to completion.

* Yay already fixed - presumably link code fixups from a week or two
   ago.  Stephen Graham structure?


  o match ligand torsions for ligand in 3oho.  Close (AFAICS) but no
    cigar - we need to add in a bond order check?  ::: 1

* Seems OK now.

  o inhibitor in 3p5k fails on torsion matching. ::: 0.5

* Fine now.

  o rework get-monomer() to be cleaner and use the prefer_python system. ::: 1

* Done.

  o update go to atom on merge water chains. ::: 0.5

* Done - simply add call to update go to atom window after change_chain_id().

  o double reading/displaying (or modification?) of HET residues? ::: 1

* It was - and the get-monomer calling it twice is fine (it re-centres).
