   o Consider relative (basename?) filenames for state file if
     current working dir string is part of full-filename string. [Andre White]  
     ::: 1

   o "Space" through waters.  Delete a water.  "space" recentres
     where?  Now do the same, but go through the waters backwards using
     "shift space" - Ingo Korndoerfer ::: 1
   
   o Make the screenshot image type be png.[JB] ::: 1

   o Check that ligand with hydrogens give good clashes [JB] ::: 2

   o In ligand torsions, a period of 0 and sd of 0 on a rotatable
     bond.
       i.e. if the sd is 0, then no torsion restraint on that tor.
       also if the period is 0, there should be no torsion
       restraints. 
       i.e. don't add a torsion restraint if the sd is 0 or the period
       is 0 

      ::: 1

   o Make python coot work on CentOS 4.  It does?  Needs testing.  ::: 2


------


   o Need a keybinding for "regularize these 3 residues". ::: 0.5

* Done.  Added to Wiki - shift B

   o Move-aside (like other dialog) the edit-chi angles dialog ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Better documentation for Sphere Refinement ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Use libcurl to get URLs.  It does proxies.  Stop using nethttp.
     ::: 4

* Done.

   o Quicksave: save all molecules (if they need saving) to default
     names and save state. ::: 1

* Done.

   o Fix the built-in help.  ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Fix Coot News ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Check waters by difference map fails on Misty's waters.  Data on
     stick.  Where is the stick?  ::: 1

* Done.

   o Can baton mode work when the skeleton runs out? ::: 2

* Done.

   o Ubuntu binary builds transfered from home ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o guile warn deprecated:
     SCM_STRINGP is deprecated.  Use scm_is_string instead.
     -> only used in coot_wrap_guile.cc
     SCM_STRING_LENGTH is deprecated.  Use scm_c_string_length instead.
     -> only used in coot_wrap_guile.cc
     scm_must_malloc is deprecated.  Use scm_gc_malloc and scm_gc_free instead.
     -> only used in coot_wrap_guile.cc
     ::: 0.5

* Done, except scm_must_malloc not done.  The solution is too deeply
  buried in SWIG.

   o Find Waters: why does it miss some nice densities sometimes?  
     Actually it looks OK (now that I did the fix for KK, presumably).
     Have a look at something other than RNase.
     ::: 4

* Looks fine now.  Tested with 2htq.

   o Baton-build mode needs to work better when starting with no
     skeleton.   ::: 1

* Done.  Nice.

   o search for, download, update binary.  Needs libcurl ::: 4

* Done.  Needs python code.

   o Keating code ::: 1

* Done.

   o SSM alignment crash, Ed Pozharski ::: 2

* Done.

   o torsion generals fails on gleevec-torsion-general-fails.pdb.  So
     does edit chi angles.  

     Not an issue.  Broken PDB files, atom names not distinguished.

* Done.

   o OXT in refinement (e.g. monomer-BCS.pdb) fails to reach
     convergence. (Note, only when OXT is not in the
     atom-list/restraints need you do something special with OXT) 
     ::: 3

* Done.

   o HK: I want a function to set the refinement weight for me, 
     i.e.  it should do a triple refine and look at the chi squareds.
     Keep doing that with different weights until we get to 1.0.  Needs
     refinement function to return SCM refinement results. ::: 2

* Done - Cool.

   o Empty macros/Makefile.am? ::: 0.5

* Done.


   o Takaaki Fukami: set occs to zero for a residue.  Add an alt conf problem:
  
     Set occ=0.0 for atoms NZ, CE, CD  (in "Residue Info..." dialog)
     Add alternate to the Lys (by "Add Alternate Conformation" button)
     Now, occ=-0.5 for the atoms NZ, CE, CD.

     ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Hydrogens should have thinner bonds.  (Not half bonds - all grey
     - more like molprobity/KING) ::: 3


* Done.

   o function documentation from cc-interface.hh ::: 2

* Done - for now.

   o Documentation and interface (when docking fails) for docking sidechains 
     ::: 1

* Done.

   o load tutorial data from an Extension menu item ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o I am looking at a symmetry-related part of the molecule. Take me
     to the main molecule (try unapplying symmetry to get there). 
     ::: 2

* Done.
