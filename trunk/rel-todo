    Points 40: April 4th

    o make a mini-rsr ::: 1

    o PISA interfaces via XML. After parsing and processing only the top
      interface should be displayed. Clicking on a line in the treeview
      should centre on the middle of the interface and turn off the
      other interfaces.    ::: 14

    o Restore a session that has an anomalous map in the state.  Fail.
      Phil Evans.   molecule-class-info-maps.cc:731 ::: 1

    o Derek Logan's SHELX Mac hydrogen problem (puntable) ::: 2

    o PIR alignment: on pressing the insertion button, go to the
      nearest residue to the gap. [Joel Bard] ::: 1 

    o trapped out of range phi/psi access: 1040 A ich: 0 ires: 895
      phi_psi_sets[ich].phi_psi.size(): 839
      Which is when the rama plot stops working  ::: 1

    o roll up/collapse addition representation in Display manager when
      they are not displayed ::: 2

    o change to rms z scores ::: 2

    o alt confs cause problems in geometry graph [JED] ::: 2

    o show-spacegroup should be deprecated.  use SCM space_group_scm()
      (etc) ::: 1

    o move molecule here:

     1. load two pdb files: a protein (imol 0) and a ligand (imol 1)
     2. open the move molecule here window. We only have the ligand
        molecule in the dropdown.
     3. Now tick the allow large molecules to move. This will put the
        protein in the dropdown.
     4. Untick the large molecules. Now we only have the ligand in the
        dropdown again (but its imol is wrong).
     5. Hit Move it.
     -> The protein moves.

     ::: 1

    o white background with ball and stick models. ::: 4

    o 3kcz fails to give ncs diferences graph. why?

    o load tutorial data gets files from a relative place? Seems
      so. ::: 0.1

    o change clipper macros to use clipper-config and not invent mmdb
      and fftw, ccp4 libraries. ::: 1

    o NCS functions in c-inteface.cc should move to c-interface-ncs.cc
      ::: 0.2

    o anisotropic atom radius. ::: 1

    o Get a molecule with high number of chains, colour by chain.  The
      grey chain comes out thin [JED]. ::: 1

    o Do ccp4i aliases work?  Ingo Korndoerfer suggest not. ::: 1


------

    o Fix rename-residue to work on just one chain ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o Move molecule here should have a check-button for "allow big
      molecules to move" ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o H-bond-only, bump-only environment distances.  ::: 1

* Done.

    o Give a dialog of the alignment done in align&mutate ::: 1

* Done.

    o SBase internal interface ::: 3

* Done.

    o Move check water by difference map into water validation dialog 
      check_waters_by_difference_map_by_widget(GtkWidget *dialog) need to go
      Also wrapped_create_check_waters_diff_map_dialog()
      ::: 3

* Done.

    o sort chains with an mmdb function ::: 4

* Done.

    o 1a34: look at the waters - they have hydrogens.  Need to change
      the bonding system.  ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o check the atoms of the residues to be refined against the
      dictionary. JED ::: 4

* Done.

    ::: 0.2

* Done.

    o does rotate/translate zone (on a water) update symmetry? [Ezra
      Peisach] ::: 0.2

* Done.

    o Felix F SHELXL symmetry problem. ::: 0.2

* Displaced residue (10 unit cells away) - Coot gives up generating
  symmetry atoms.

    o Make RSR interuptable ::: 2

* Done.

    o Fix transform map interface for 5 arguments  ::: 0.2

* Done.

    o SBase GUI ::: 2

* Done.

    o coot --update-self (runs in no-graphics mode.  Put the old
      directories in a dated directory, version and revision. ::: 1

* Done.

    o bad-rigid-body-atom-set.pdb fails to rigid body refine.  Why? 
     (instability in the minimizer!) ::: 1.5
 
* Done.

    o Regularize Sphere ::: 0.6

* Done.

    o On assigning sequence (after baton building etc) Coot gives me a
      dialog that says the confidence is not sufficiently high for an
      assigment - although an assigment was made ::: 0.5

* Done.

    o accept sphere refine when geometry graph is displayed -> crash. [JED] 
      Test terminal output with geometry graph up, with sphere refine
      and linear refine.
      ::: 3

* Done.

    o make pointer distances update on go-to-blob [JED] ::: 0.3
   
* Done.

    o undisplay merged molecules ::: 0.3

* Done.

    o NCS differences was broken by gaps not of the same length [Ingo
      Korndoerfer] ::: 1

    o get reverse NCS skip working ::: 2

* Done.

    o Edit -> restraints for XX6, plane restraints sigma.  Close edit
      again -> fail.  Also Take N2 and O out of plane restraints. 
 
        - That is now unreproducable - maybe related to below (it was
        changing the wrong comp_id).

      The tlc for XX6 seems to be " " - why is that? It's because the
      cif was wrongly written. ::: 2
