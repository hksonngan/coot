   o jiggle fit leaves behind atoms that have zero occupancy? 
     e.g. jiggle-fit the acedrg output of Acedrg on I79.cif in 3rvb

   o jiggle fit should use a map that has masked out density for
     neighbour residues.

   o compile a coot without python

   o compile a coot without guile-gtk

     o Coot crashes on using the About dialog

   Mark Saper on a Mac (no guile-gtk):

1. Upon exiting Coot I receive these lines in the terminal output.  The window asking about clearing backups is never shown.

    ...
    (coot-checked-exit 0)
    (clear-backups-maybe)
    ((safe_scheme_command) Error in proc: key:  unbound-variable  args:  (#f Unbound variable: ~S (gtk-window-new) #f))
    WARNING:: (clear-backups-maybe) returns object: #<unspecified>

   o Torsion fit this residue pyrogen-I79.pdb in 3rvb

   o Check this ligand

   o dictionary bonds:  I79 Do we have these ones:

INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CR56 S2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CR6 CL
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CH2 NR5
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CR6 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CR6 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond C OC
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond C OC
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond CR5 S2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond HNC2 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond HNC2 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond HNC2 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond HNC2 NH2
INFO:: falling back to permissive search for bond HOH1 OC

   o I79 short bonds to H18,H19 from N3

   o Try glyco tree builder 528 on 4lxr. 

   o build NAG-NAG on 3bt1 on 172U ASN.

* Nasty - and interesting.

   o a nice function - for ligand presentation (and rendering) is to
     find the screen centre and view quaternion that orients the ligand
     nicely. Puntable.

   o fix the alerts on importing mol/residue -> 2d
