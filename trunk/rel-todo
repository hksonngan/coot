   o sphere-refine in a region with undisplayed add-reps -> add reps
     displayed. ::: 1

   o Check that sort chain ids does indeed sort the chain ids and does
     not change the order of the atoms in the molecule.  Convert to minimol 
     and sort the chains there - make sure that cell and symm are transfered.
     [Steven Sheriff, Bob Nolte] ::: 1

   o Add terminal residue has disconnected atoms.  Why? ::: 1

   o Rotate Translate: Add an additional GUI (possibly in the toolbar)
     to specify the type of R/T entity, a zone (default) a chain, a
     whole molecule. ::: 5

* Almost Done. Exception of adding to the GUI the ability to swap
  rot_trans_object_type modes.

   o multiple residue ranges, glycosylation, covalent bond entities ::: 10

* What else is there to do here?  Write a test.


   o Seg Ids (Mailing list issue):

      At least in these two situations, I think that COOT could make a
      very educated guess as to the correct SEGID.

       * In mutate (simple or otherwise), COOT could carry over what
         existed for the residue being mutated

       * In "insert after terminal residue" COOT could carry over what
         exists for the terminal residue

      These might not always be correct, but they should be 99+% of
      the time.

     Also mails from Phil Evans, Stephen Graham, Early April 2008
     about SEG ids.  Doing a NCS loop with Seg ids.  Doing a mutation
     with Segids (might be the same issue).  The segid for the new
     atoms should be inherited from those of the rest of the residue
     (if they are consistent). ::: 6

* mutate done (needs a test?).  But what about ncs-copy-residue-range? 
  Done, needs test. And what about add_terminal_residue, which uses
  NEW_COORDS_INSERT, I think.  It does. Coded, needs a test
  (set-atom-string-attribute now can take a "segid" tag), so we're 
  all set to make a test.


   o "Fit ligand here" which gets a monomer then does a ligand search
     based on the blob at the current position. ::: 8

* I added a function to find a blob close to the given postion, then
  add it as a cluster.  That was fun. It made the cluster correctly,
  same as reference (blob 2).  Then trying to do wiggly ligands there
  I ran in to the problem.  I was wondering why I was getting a poor
  solution, the ribose was always rotated (compared to the reference
  and correct solution).  Why?  The torsion was wrong.  In the
  dictionary we have

 3GP      var_2    C8     N9     C1*    C2*      -78.375    2.000   1

  There is a torsion round N9 C1 - and in the wiggly ligand models it
  was always wrong.  It turns out that wiggly ligands was setting the
  torsion of the C8 N9 C1* H1* instead.  Hopelessly wrong.  To fix
  this needs a re-write of the torsion setting code. Sigh.  Strange
  that I haven't notice this before.  Waiting for Stuart to fix
  SetDihedralAngle().


   o Bill: This might be hard to implement, but in case it isn't, I
     thought it might be worth suggesting...

     It would be great to be able to click on a nucleotide base in a
     single strand of DNA or RNA and generate its W/C partner...  ::: 4
 
* Not so hard - generate a WC pair (just one base, double
  stranded). Fit the base atoms of one of those to the
  clicked-on-residue. Use the matrix to move the other residue.
  Bingo.  Needs atom-by-atom matching in the least-squares procedure -
  may need thinking about that. Bernhard mentioned that he would
  be looking at atom matching in lsq, so I will leave it for now.
  The base-pairing files are in ligand dir now.

   o Investigate interupting long fitting/Post MR tools [JED request] 
     Add a stop button to the toolbar perhaps.
     ::: 2

* gtk-toolbar-insert and gtk-toolbutton-new are not available in
  guile-gtk-2.0, or so it currently seems to me.  This can't be done
  from scripting then. Hmm... [Probably possible in python].  Does
  this mean I should consider looking at guile-gnome?  Or how about
  coot-add-main-toolbar-stop-toolbutton which gets passed a function
  to call when the button is clicked.  Need to think about how the
  button goes away without being clicked.  Pass back the widget?
  Seems complex - how about just destroy-toolbar-stop-toolbutton. Yes.
  Should those refinement scripts be run as idle functions then?  

   o redo sequence view ::: 10

   o Backrub-based auto-fit rotamer search.  Question: how do I test
     this? Synthetic map?  How does it work when we do this for an alt
     conf too?  ::: 10

   o Communication with PISA.  Get PISA on jackal.  I'd like show the

   o sphere-refine:  turn on rama restraints for restraints from residue_vec.
    make_link_restraints_by_linear() has
    if (do_rama_plot_restraints)
      add_rama_links(selHnd, geom);

    make_link_restraints_from_res_vec() has
    add_rama_links_from_res_vec(), but that is not filled.
    need something like bonded_residues_from_res_vec(), but for
    residue triples - returning 3 residues.

   o Fix up mini-RSR so that it compiles properly. ::: 4

   o Put refine-zone and regularize-zone into the history. ::: 2

   o consider making bonds to hydrogens thinner.  A spike needed to
     test for bonds split on thickness or colour most deeply.  ::: 5

   o Can we have a regularize-residues function?  That would be cool
     for fixing molecular models. ::: 2

   o Gtk2 coot: set the colour patch in the map properties and
     symmetry molecule colouring (needs version 2.6).  There is some
     problem in the update, how do I set continuous updates on the

   o Integrate scripting functions into main documentation somehow.
     Well, you can look at this, if it is hard, punt it.  
     ::: 2
 
* It looks like it can be done using @html, @end html stripping out the
  body etc tags. Ugly though.  Include files need to be in source doc
  directory.  Call it xxx.html.texi and add @html tags in there.

   o *create* a molecule by symmetry, not (just) write it out.
      Consider a dialog to Write/Create a symmetry molecule.  ::: 2

   o Geometric distortions graph for alt confs - currently broken? ::: 4

   o Stereo (hardware, side by side) Add-reps.  Need to update the

     When switching stereo contexts creating a new GL context, we need
     to run update_additional_representations() for each model molecule.

    ::: 2


------

   o Does is_mainchain_atom() working for mainchain hydrogens?  
     You mean is_main_chain_p().  Yes it is.
     ::: 1

   o need (residues-near-point imol radius) function.  ::: 1

* Done.  With test.  Needs python version filled.

   o Dynamic distances define need a pick cursor. ::: 1

* Easy.  Done 

   o rotamer-score function needs to be filled ::: 1

* Done.  Added test.

   o Move widget functions in c-interface-build.cc to
     c-interface-gui.cc (or consider new c-interface-build-gui.cc). ::: 1

* Done with the c-interface-build-gui.cc option.

   o Give the user a chance to edit the ins file before it is sent off
     for refinement [Tobias Beck].  Not doing so, as currently,
     practically makes the shelxl refine in Coot useless if the user
     needs to modify the file.  Fire up a text widget with the .ins file
     in it.  ::: 2

* Done.  Quite easy.

   o Rotamer plots need to update on multiple do/undos. ::: 1

* Done. Easy - just call update_geometry_graphs() with an asc on
  apply_undo().

   o enable --splash-screen  ::: 1

* Easy.  Create a function, added to the bottom of gtk-manual.cc.
  Tricky thing was to edit support.c to check this directory and
  absolute path name.  Will the changes to support.c remain intact?
  Or does support.c get overwritten?  Maybe, on using post-glade.  OK,
  I have turned off the writing of support files in glade.

   o Consider setting the "handled" flag only for key pressed that did
     something, e.g. we could then use the "B" and "S" keys, because they
     are not often used.  Maybe "A" too. ::: 1

* Done.

   o The lib dir should be set with AC_CHECK_LIB, not just "lib". Tim
     Fenn. ::: 2
 
* Let's hear from Tim Fenn.  OK, he replied.  Non-trivial. 
  OK, done I think.  I used AC_LIB_PREPARE_MULTILIB and $acl_libdirstem.
  I am presuming that does what he wanted.  On re-reading, perhaps
  not (but only perhaps).

   o add a mechanism where we can register functions to run after
     refinement and/or regularization. 
  
     or deleting things says JED.  In fact, a funtion to run that is
      attached to a molecule (somehow) on any
      update/change/manipulation. ::: 2

* Done for scm, I added manipulation-modes.hh so that the
  MOVINGATOMS, DELETED and MUTATED variables were available from
  scheme, (an _ in MOVING_ATOMS means that fails to be exported).

   o colour by B-factor CA mode, (CA + Ligs atom sel should be used
     for B-factor colouring mode).  Don't forget picking
     (grphics-info-pick c.f. CA_BONDS_PLUS_LIGANDS_SEC_STRUCT_COLOUR)
     ::: 1

* Done.


   o Use write_connectivity to generate ligand hydrogens. Use reduce
     and probe to make ligand interactions. It might be needed to ask
     Eugene about this.  Typical example is I have a model/PDB of
     protein and a model/PDB that has CONECT cards (written by
     write-connectivity and then appened to the PDB file).  I want to
     merge ligand with its connectivity to the protein molecule.  Or
     generate the connectivity and add it directly to the ligand
     molecule without going via a file and file append.

     I went for the separate file and append option with goosh-command
     and cat.  Works nicely. 
     ::: 1

* Well, that it works nicely was nothing to do with me, as it turns
  out, and everything to do with new probe (I suppose).  I doesn't
  need CONECT cards to do the ligand hydrogen contacts now.


   o need a function (bound to Shift D) to update dots centred around
     this point.  interactive-probe does something like we want, but
     with the filenames already written to disk.  We need to protect
     interactive-probe by checking a global flag that is set the
     first time we run interactive-probe (i.e. we test for
     command-in-path? only once) ::: 1

* This turned out to be much harder that I'd supposed.  First, I
  needed to turn off the Shifted key bindings (now D is different to
  d).  Next, I had to write a new routine probe-local-sphere which
  uses get-probe-dots-from.  There was a problem because if the atom
  selection radius and the probe radius are the same, then sometimes
  the middle atom of a bonded angle set is missing (outside the
  sphere) and that leads to bad clashes.  So I had to update
  new-molecule-by-sphere-selection to allow the writing of whole
  residues optionally.  This prevents the missing middle atom problem
  and now the probe-local-sphere works nicely. There is a problem of
  alt confs here though.  The alt conf specifier in
  deep_copy_this_residue() is checked "by hand" so "*" doesn't work.
  Maybe deep_copy_this_residue() [mmdb-extras, I think] should be
  changed so that it does.


   o Display ligand diapoles using charges from cif file. ::: 4

* There was a problem in orienting the dipole arrow.  Talk with Kevin
  fixed that.  I needed a dummy point to fill the rotation matrix.


   o Why does NAG not refine? e.g. 1h4p. ::: 2
     
* Actually it refines fine.  The problem is that 1h4p has residues out
  of order which mess up the residue selection. Let's add a function
  that test if residues are number in increasing order for a
  particular chain.  Let's use that function and if they are not in
  order, then add that to the warning text of the
  no_restraints_dialog.  OK, needs testing on a PDB file that has an
  unknown monomer but residues are not out of order.  OK, tested. Fine.


   o geometry graph for residues at a gap - makes an inappropriate
     link - e.g. 45-47 - it should check by distance.  Make sure that
     a gap between a refined residue and a flank is handled properly
     (i.e. there should be no flanking restraints in that direction).
     ::: 1 [JED]

* Seems good now (including flanking refine). 20080112.

   o find-waters --mapin 3bwp.map ... fails to run (silently) but
     using --hklin, --f and --phi worked. ::: 1

* Done.  'if' logic messed up. 20080112.

   o reset view behaves strangely sometimes? ::: 1

* Done.  A fixed value was being used in
  setRotationCentreAndZoom(). 20080112

   o Add a test for clear of generic object. ::: 1

* Done.  There was a bug in indexing of the generic object
  array. 20080112

   o Art authors: 
       world in connect-to-world is "cartoon globe" by lunanaut
       computer mouse for scroll wheel by crispy.

* Done.

   o write_residue_range_to_pdb_file need to write the correct chain
     ::: 1

* Done.

   o Refine CL - should behave sensibly - possibly looking at
     neighbours e.g. sphere refine ::: 2

* Done.

   o Add terminal residue does not respect the default B factor [Pete
     Meyer] ::: 1

   o add the ability to turn off shadows in raster3d output ::: 1

* Done.

   o displaying additional representations turns symmetry equivalent
     atoms into fat bonds. [JED] ::: 1

* Done.

   o Add a GUI for mutate-by-overlap acting on active-residue.
     Simple, use generic-single-entry ::: 1

* Done for scm.

   o Make it more clear that the SMILES interface uses libcheck.
     (perhaps grey out the function if libcheck is not available).
     ::: 1

* Done.

   o When a new residue is created (e.g. HOH) it should be checked
     against standard PDB residue types and if not found, then the
     atoms in the residue should be marked as HETATMs (set atom->Het).
     [ David Mathog noted problem]

     http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/Format_v32_letter.pdf

     Consider hetify_residue_atoms_maybe(residue_p) which checks the
     residue name against standard pdb residue names, and if not
     there, then hetifies the atoms.

     Need to call this when reading the monomer-XXX.pdb output of
     libcheck.

     ::: 2

* Done.

   o A dipole for a selection of residues. Needs a test. ::: 2

* Done.
